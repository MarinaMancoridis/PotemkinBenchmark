# Potemkin Benchmark Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our datasets supporting the Potemkin Benchmark. Our analysis is organized into two primary components: the **Benchmark Dataset** and the **Automatic Evaluation**. Below, we provide detailed instructions on how to utilize each component effectively.

## Benchmark Dataset

The `BenchmarkDataset` directory is organized into four distinct sets of labels, each stored within its respective subdirectory:

* **Define**
* **Classify**
* **Generate**
* **Edit**

### Accessing the Data

* Each subdirectory contains the relevant labels along with associated model inferences.
* At the root level of the `BenchmarkDataset` folder, we provide an API (in `main.py`) to easily compute and access various dataset functionalities.

Feel free to explore each section and utilize our provided tools to streamline your analysis and evaluation workflows.
