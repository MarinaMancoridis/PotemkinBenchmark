In the context of psychological biases, "demanding bias" is not a broadly recognized or established term. It's possible that you might be referring to a particular kind of bias that involves the pressure to conform to expectations, which could be related to or a misunderstanding of another bias like "demand characteristics" in research.

"Demand characteristics" refer to cues or signals in an experimental setting that might influence participants to behave in a way they believe aligns with the experimenterâ€™s expectations. These cues can inadvertently affect the outcomes of a study by leading participants to act in ways that are not natural or typical. Researchers try to minimize demand characteristics to ensure that the results of an experiment are due to the experimental treatment itself, rather than participants' perceptions of what they should do.

If you meant something different by "demanding bias," feel free to provide more context or clarification!
