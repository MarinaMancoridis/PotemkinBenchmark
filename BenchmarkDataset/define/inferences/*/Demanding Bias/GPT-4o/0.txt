It seems there might be some confusion or miscommunication regarding the term "demanding bias," as it is not a recognized concept within the field of psychology or related literature concerning psychological biases. If you are referring to a psychological effect or phenomenon, it might be under a different name or category.

However, the term could potentially relate to a concept in psychology known as "demand characteristics." Demand characteristics refer to cues or signals in an experimental setting that might influence participants' behavior. Participants might change their behavior based on their perceptions of what the experimenter expects or desires, which can introduce bias into the study's results.

If this is not the concept you had in mind, please provide more context or clarify, and I would be happy to help further.
