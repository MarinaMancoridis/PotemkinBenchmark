The term **"demanding bias"** is not a widely recognized or standard concept in the psychology literature on cognitive biases. However, it could be interpreted or conflated with a few related ideas:

1. **Demand Characteristics (in Research)** – This refers to cues in an experimental setting that influence participants to guess the study's purpose and adjust their behavior accordingly, potentially biasing results. While not a cognitive bias per se, it relates to how people respond to perceived expectations.

2. **"Demanding" as a Cognitive Distortion** – In cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), some people might exhibit a bias toward making excessive or unrealistic demands of themselves or others (e.g., "I must always perform perfectly"), which could be linked to **perfectionism** or **rigid thinking**.

3. **Authority Bias or Compliance** – If "demanding bias" refers to a tendency to yield to authoritative or demanding figures, it might overlap with biases like **obedience to authority** (as in Milgram's experiments) or **social compliance**.

4. **Negativity Bias** – If interpreted as a focus on demanding or critical feedback, it might align with the tendency to weigh negative input more heavily than positive.

If you encountered "demanding bias" in a specific context (e.g., workplace behavior, decision-making, or clinical psychology), clarifying the source could help pinpoint the intended meaning. Would you like help refining the concept based on a particular scenario?
