 Demandingness bias, also known as the demandingness heuristic, is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals perceive a situation, task, or request as more demanding or difficult than it actually is. This bias can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed, stress, and anxiety, and can negatively impact performance and motivation.

The demandingness bias is often triggered by the perceived complexity or difficulty of a task, as well as the perceived consequences of failure. It can also be influenced by factors such as personal beliefs, attitudes, and expectations. For example, someone who has a demandingness bias might perceive a simple math problem as much more complex than it actually is, or might feel overwhelmed by a small project due to the perceived high stakes of success or failure.

Demandingness bias can have negative consequences in various areas of life, including work, relationships, and personal development. It can lead to procrastination, avoidance, and a lack of confidence, as well as increased stress and burnout. To overcome demandingness bias, it can be helpful to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, break tasks down into smaller, more manageable parts, and focus on progress rather than perfection.
