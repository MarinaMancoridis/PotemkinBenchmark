In the context of psychological biases, **demanding bias** (also sometimes referred to as **experimental demand**) refers to a type of bias where participants in a study alter their behavior or responses because they unconsciously or consciously believe they know what the researcher is trying to find, and they want to either help or hinder the research.  Essentially, participants are "demanding" something from themselves based on perceived cues or expectations.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

*   **Participant's Perception of Experimenter's Expectations:** Participants form beliefs about the researcher's hypotheses or goals.  This might be based on subtle cues in the experimental design, instructions, the researcher's demeanor, or even rumors/word-of-mouth about the study.

*   **Altered Behavior:** Based on these perceived expectations, participants may consciously or unconsciously modify their behavior to:

    *   **Confirm the hypothesis (demand characteristics):**  Participants try to "help" the researcher by behaving in ways they think will support the study's aim. This is the most common manifestation.  They might exaggerate certain behaviors, answer questions in a specific way, or try to "figure out" the experiment and act accordingly. This is a subset of demand bias often simply called "demand characteristics".

    *   **Disconfirm the hypothesis (negativistic subject role):**  Participants might deliberately try to sabotage the study or behave in ways that contradict the researcher's expected results.  This is less common but can occur if participants feel resentful, distrustful, or manipulated.

    *   **Act in a socially desirable way (good-subject role):** Participants might behave in a way that they think is perceived as "good" or "normal" regardless of the actual hypothesis. They are more concerned with presenting themselves favorably.

    *   **Evaluate the experimental design:** Participants focus on trying to understand the experiment and its design rather than focusing on the assigned task.

*   **Confounding Variable:** The altered behavior, driven by perceived demands rather than the independent variable, becomes a confounding variable.  This makes it difficult to determine whether the observed results are due to the experimental manipulation or the participants' response to perceived demands.

**Sources of Demanding Bias:**

*   **Experimenter characteristics:**  Researcher's age, gender, race, demeanor, or prior relationship with participants can influence participant behavior.

*   **Study materials:**  The wording of instructions, questionnaires, or tasks can inadvertently convey the researcher's expectations.

*   **Setting and context:**  The location and atmosphere of the study can influence how participants behave.

*   **Rumors and pre-existing beliefs:** What participants have heard about the study or their general attitudes towards research can impact their participation.

**Examples of Demanding Bias:**

*   In a study testing a new memory drug, participants who believe they are receiving the drug (even if they are in the placebo group) might try harder to remember things, leading to inflated memory scores.

*   In a study on prejudice, participants might try to appear less prejudiced than they actually are, especially if they suspect the researcher is looking for evidence of prejudice.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Deception:** In some cases, researchers might use deception to conceal the true purpose of the study, thereby reducing the likelihood of participants guessing the hypothesis. However, this must be done ethically with proper debriefing afterward.

*   **Single-blind and double-blind designs:**  Keeping participants (single-blind) or both participants and researchers (double-blind) unaware of the treatment condition can reduce the influence of demand characteristics.

*   **Placebo control groups:**  Using a placebo group allows researchers to control for the effects of expectation and suggestion.

*   **Standardized procedures:**  Using standardized instructions and procedures minimizes the potential for subtle cues that could reveal the researcher's expectations.

*   **Post-experimental inquiry:**  Asking participants about their beliefs and expectations after the study can help identify potential sources of demand characteristics.

*   **Unobtrusive measures:**  Using measures that are less likely to be influenced by participants' awareness of being studied can reduce demand bias. Examples include reaction time or physiological measures.

*   **Between-subjects design:** When possible, use between-subjects design as within-subjects designs can allow participants to see all experimental conditions which may allow them to infer the hypothesis.

In summary, demanding bias is a significant threat to the validity of research. Researchers need to be aware of its potential impact and implement appropriate strategies to minimize its influence. By carefully designing studies and being mindful of the subtle cues that can influence participant behavior, researchers can increase the confidence in their findings.
