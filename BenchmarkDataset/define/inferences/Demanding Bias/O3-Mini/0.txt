In the context of psychological biases, "demanding bias" is not a widely recognized term or concept. It’s possible that there might be some confusion with more established terms related to demand characteristics or biases in psychological research.

Demand characteristics refer to subtle cues or signals in an experimental setting that might influence participants' behavior. These cues can make participants aware of the expected outcome or how they are supposed to respond, potentially leading to biased or skewed results.

If "demanding bias" is being used in a specific context or niche field, it might refer to a concept that overlaps with how expectations or pressures can shape behavior or cognition. However, without more context or references, it’s hard to provide a precise definition for "demanding bias."

If you came across this term in a particular study or field, it might be worthwhile to check the source for any specific context or explanation given by the authors.
