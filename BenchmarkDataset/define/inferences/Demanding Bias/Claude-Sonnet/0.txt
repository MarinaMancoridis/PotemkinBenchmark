Demanding bias is a cognitive bias where individuals tend to overvalue or place excessive importance on things simply because they had to work hard to obtain them or because they were difficult to achieve. This bias can lead people to attribute more worth or significance to outcomes that required more effort, regardless of their actual value or merit. This is related to the "effort justification" phenomenon, where people justify their investments of time and energy by inflating the value of the end result.

For example:
- Someone might think their college degree is more valuable because it was challenging to obtain
- A person might overvalue a promotion because they struggled to get it
- Someone might place higher value on handmade items because they took more effort to create

This bias can affect decision-making and value judgments, sometimes leading people to maintain commitment to difficult pursuits even when more efficient alternatives exist.
