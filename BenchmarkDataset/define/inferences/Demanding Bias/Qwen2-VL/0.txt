Demanding bias is a type of cognitive bias in which an individual has an unrealistic or unreasonable expectation of others. This bias can lead to frustration, disappointment, and conflict in relationships. It can also prevent individuals from being able to appreciate the positive qualities and contributions of others, and can lead to a negative and critical mindset.
