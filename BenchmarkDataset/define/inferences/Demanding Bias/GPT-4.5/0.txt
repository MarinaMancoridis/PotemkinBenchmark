It seems like there might be some confusion regarding the term "demanding bias," as it is not a recognized concept in the realm of psychological biases. Psychological biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and they often come into play in various cognitive processes such as decision-making, problem-solving, and perception.

Some commonly known psychological biases include:

- **Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
- **Anchoring Bias**: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
- **Availability Heuristic**: Overestimating the importance of information readily available in one's memory, often due to recent exposure or vividness.
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: The discomfort experienced when holding two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes.

If "demanding bias" is used in a specific context or specialized field, it might have a particular meaning there. Otherwise, you might be referring to another well-documented bias. If you can provide more context or details, I might be able to assist you further.
