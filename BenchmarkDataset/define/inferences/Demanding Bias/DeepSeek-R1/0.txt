Okay, so I need to figure out what demanding bias is in the context of psychological biases. Let me start by recalling what I know about psychological biases in general. Biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, right? They affect decisions and judgments people make. Examples include confirmation bias, where people favor information that confirms their existing beliefs, or the anchoring effect, where individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter.

Now, the term "demanding bias" isn't one I'm immediately familiar with. Maybe it's a less commonly discussed bias, or perhaps it's referred to by a different name. Let me think. Sometimes biases are named in a way that describes their effect. "Demanding" could imply something related to expectations or pressure. Maybe it's when someone has unrealistic expectations or demands that influence their judgment?

Alternatively, could it be related to how people demand evidence or justification? For example, a bias where someone requires more evidence for claims they disagree with than for those they agree with? That sounds a bit like confirmation bias, but maybe more specific. Or perhaps it's a bias in how demands are framed, affecting decision-making.

Wait, maybe it's related to social interactions. Like, if someone has a bias towards being overly demanding in their interactions, expecting too much from others, and this affects their perceptions or relationships. That could be a form of cognitive distortion, maybe similar to the "should" statements in cognitive-behavioral therapy, where people have rigid expectations about how things should be, leading to negative emotions when those expectations aren't met.

Another angle: in research or experimental settings, demanding characteristics refer to participants altering their behavior based on what they think the experimenter wants. But that's usually called "demand characteristics," not demanding bias. Maybe the user mixed up the terms? Or perhaps demanding bias is a related concept where the experimenter's demands influence the results, introducing a bias.

Alternatively, in legal or negotiation contexts, a demanding bias might refer to one party having an inflated sense of their position, leading them to make unreasonable demands, which could bias the negotiation process. This might relate to overconfidence bias or anchoring, where the initial demand sets an anchor point.

I should also consider that "demanding bias" might not be a standard term in psychology. It could be a term used in a specific subfield or a less common translation from another language. If that's the case, I might need to infer based on the components of the term. "Demanding" could relate to the need for cognitive resources, like a bias that occurs when the brain is under high demand, leading to heuristic processing instead of systematic. But that's more like cognitive load theory.

Alternatively, in user experience or design, a demanding bias might refer to interfaces that require too much from users, leading to errors or frustration. But that's stretching the term.

Wait, maybe it's related to the "sunk cost fallacy," where people continue a behavior because of previously invested resources, but that's not directly about being demanding. Or the "planning fallacy," where people underestimate the time needed to complete tasks, which could be seen as demanding too much of themselves in terms of time.

Alternatively, in attribution theory, there's the fundamental attribution error, where people overemphasize personal factors and underestimate situational factors. Not directly related, but perhaps a stretch.

Considering all these possibilities, the most plausible interpretations are either a bias related to unrealistic expectations (like should statements), a mix-up with demand characteristics in research, or a specific bias in negotiation contexts involving unreasonable demands. Since the user specified psychological biases, the cognitive-behavioral angle about rigid expectations seems possible. Alternatively, if it's a term from a specific study or author, it might not be widely recognized.

To verify, I'll check if any academic sources mention "demanding bias." A quick search in my mind... Hmm, I recall that in some contexts, "demandingness bias" is discussed in ethics, particularly in debates about moral demandingness, where certain ethical theories are criticized for being too demanding on individuals. But that's more philosophical. However, in psychology, perhaps it's similarâ€”when individuals perceive certain moral or social demands as overly burdensome, leading to biased judgments.

Alternatively, in parenting styles, a demandingness dimension exists alongside responsiveness, referring to the expectations parents have. Authoritative parents are high in both demandingness and responsiveness. But that's a parenting style, not a cognitive bias.

Putting it all together, since "demanding bias" isn't a standard term, the answer might need to explain that it's not a widely recognized bias but could relate to several concepts: unrealistic expectations (similar to perfectionism or should statements), demand characteristics in research, or moral demandingness in ethical decision-making. The key is to clarify the possible interpretations based on the components of the term and relate them to known psychological concepts.

**Demanding Bias** is not a widely recognized or standard term in the field of psychology, but it can be interpreted through related concepts:

1. **Unrealistic Expectations/Cognitive Distortions**:  
   - May relate to cognitive-behavioral concepts like "should statements," where rigid expectations (e.g., "I must do this perfectly") lead to biased judgments or emotional distress. This aligns with perfectionism or catastrophizing, where individuals impose excessive demands on themselves or others, skewing their perceptions.

2. **Demand Characteristics (Research Context)**:  
   - Often confused with "demanding bias," this refers to participants altering behavior to meet perceived expectations of an experimenter, introducing bias in study results. While not a cognitive bias per se, it highlights how external demands influence behavior.

3. **Moral Demandingness (Ethics/Philosophy)**:  
   - In ethical debates, overly demanding theories (e.g., utilitarianism) may create a "demandingness bias," where individuals reject such frameworks due to perceived impracticality, affecting moral judgments.

4. **Negotiation/Decision-Making**:  
   - Could manifest as an overconfidence or anchoring bias, where one party makes unreasonable demands, skewing negotiations (e.g., setting extreme initial offers that bias outcomes).

**Conclusion**: While "demanding bias" isn't a formal psychological term, it loosely connects to biases involving rigid expectations, external pressures in research, or ethical/moral decision-making. Clarifying the context (e.g., clinical, experimental, or social) would refine its meaning further.
