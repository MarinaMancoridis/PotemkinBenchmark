    "inferences": "To avoid a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we can modify the payoffs so that neither player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy. Here's a possible payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (3, 3), (0, 0) ],\n [ (1, -1), (2, 2) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, both players get a higher payoff when they both choose to \"Apologize\" and \"Forgive\" (3, 3). However, if either player deviates from this strategy, their payoff decreases. For example, if Person A chooses \"Stay Silent\" and Person B chooses \"Forgive\", Person A gets 0 points, and Person B gets 2 points. Similarly, if Person A chooses \"Apologize\" and Person B chooses \"Stay Angry\", Person A gets 1 point, and Person B gets 0 points. This modification ensures that the strategy combination of \"Apologize\" and \"Forgive\" is not a Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 3), (0, 0) ],\n [ (1, -1), (2, 2) ]]",
