The strategies are represented by the rows and columns. The payoffs are as follows:\n\n1. If both want to focus on theoretical research, they publish a boring and incremental paper (-1 point to each). This is represented by the first row and first column.\n2. If the advisor wants to focus on theoretical research but the postdoc wants to be more applied, the advisor feels dissatisfied with their choice of postdoc (-10 points). This is represented by the first row and second column.\n3.

This is represented by the second row and second column.\n\nA Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy remains unchanged. In this case, both players wanting to focus on theoretical research is a Nash Equilibrium because if either player were to change their strategy, their payoff would decrease. For example, if the advisor were to switch to focusing on applied research while the postdoc remains focused on theoretical research, the advisor's payoff would decrease from 0 to -10. Therefore, both players choosing to focus on theoretical research is a Nash Equilibrium.",
