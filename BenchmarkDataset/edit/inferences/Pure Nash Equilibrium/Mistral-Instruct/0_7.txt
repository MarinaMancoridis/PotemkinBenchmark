The numbers represent the payoffs for the King (row player) and the Jester (column player) respectively.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Nash Equilibrium:\n\nA Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.\n\nIn this game, the Nash Equilibrium can be found when both the King and the Jester are in a strategy where neither has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the strategy of the other player.\n\nOne possible Nash Equilibrium is when the King demands Serious Advice and the Jester provides Serious Advice, as shown in the first row and first column of the payoff matrix. In this case, neither player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. If the King were to demand Comedy instead, the Jester would still provide Serious Advice, as the King would receive -10 points, and the Jester would receive 0 points. Similarly, if the Jester were to perform Comedy instead, the King would still demand Serious Advice, as the King would receive -10 points, and the Jester would receive -5 points.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, -1), (-10, 0) ],\n [ (-10, 0), (-5, -5) ]]\n\nThe Nash Equilibrium in this game is when the King demands Serious Advice and the Jester provides Serious Advice.",
