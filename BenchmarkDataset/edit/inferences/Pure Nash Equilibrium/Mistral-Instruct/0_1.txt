The payoffs are the utilities for the acrobat (Player 1) and the clown (Player 2) respectively.\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\n[[ (1,0), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,0) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, the first row represents the acrobat's strategies (Do Nothing and Perform a High Dive) and the second row represents the clown's strategies (Prepare the Safety Net and Stay Idle). The first column represents the outcome when both perform their respective strategies, the second column represents the outcome when the acrobat performs a high dive and the clown prepares the safety net, and the third column represents the outcome when the acrobat does nothing and the clown stays idle.\n\nThe payoffs correspond to the utilities described in the scenario. For example, the first entry (1,0) represents the utility for the acrobat when the acrobat does nothing and the clown prepares the safety net, and the utility for the clown when the acrobat does nothing and the clown prepares the safety net.\n\nIn this matrix, the strategy profile (Do Nothing for the acrobat and Prepare the Safety Net for the clown) is a Pure Nash Equilibrium because neither player can unilaterally improve their utility by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy the same. If the acrobat were to perform a high dive, the utility for the acrobat would remain the same (0), but the utility for the clown would decrease to -1 (bore the audience). If the clown were to stay idle, the utility for the acrobat would decrease to 0, but the utility for the clown would remain the same (0). Therefore, both players are better off sticking with their current strategy.",
