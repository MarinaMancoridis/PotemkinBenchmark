    "inferences": "A Pure Nash Equilibrium occurs when each player's strategy is the best response to the other's strategy, resulting in no player having an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their current strategy.\n\nGiven the payoff matrix in the scenario:\n\n- If both twins go to the park: (-1, -1)\n- Twin A goes to the park, Twin B stays home: (-10, 0)\n- Twin B goes to the park, Twin A stays home: (0, -10)\n- If both stay home: (-5, -5)\n\nThe previous payoff, when both stay home, is not a Pure Nash Equilibrium, as both players receive -5 points each and can improve their payoffs by unilaterally changing their strategies.\n\nTo remove the Pure Nash Equilibrium of both staying home, we must ensure that changing their strategy will never result in a better payoff for any unilateral action. In other words, any single player moving away from the strategy of staying home should not improve their payoff.\n\nHowever, if both go to the park, each receives -1 points which is still a detrimental outcome. \n\nNow, adjust the payoff matrix so that there is no Pure Nash Equilibrium:\n\n- Payoffs when both go to the park: (3, 3)\n- Payoffs when Twin A goes to the park, Twin B stays home: (-10, 0)\n- Payoffs when Twin B goes to the park, Twin A stays home: (0, -10)\n- Payoffs when both stay home: (-5, -5)\n\nIn this adjusted matrix, neither player can gain by changing their strategy unilaterally when both strategies lead to better collective outcomes at the park as compared to each of the other strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (3, 3), (-10, 0) ],\n [ (0, -10), (-5, -5) ]]",
