    "inferences": "To ensure that the scenario is not an instance of a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs in such a way that any chosen strategy pair for the players allows at least one player to improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. In game theory, a Pure Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other player's strategy remains unchanged.\n\nLet's revise the payoff matrix for the scenario:\n\nOriginal Payoff Matrix:\n[[ (-1, -1), (-10, 0) ],\n [ (0, -10), (-5, -5) ]]\n\nIn our attempt to eliminate a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we aim for each strategy pair to maintain the possibility for at least one player to increase their payoff by altering their approach. This ensures that no static optimal strategy pair exists for both players. Let's adjust some of the payoffs to invalidate Nash Equilibria:\n\n1. If both players choose their first strategy, let's improve the payoffs slightly to encourage a shift.\n2. If the artist opts for commercial work while the agent doesn't, let's retain the same since the agent is indifferent.\n3. If the artist goes personal and the agent chooses commercial strategies, let's bring down the agent's payoff to motivate change.\n4. If both choose the second strategy, the situation remains unchanged as intended for a negative outcome.\n\n- Artists focusing on commercial work while both initially chose personal: Increase agent's payoff slightly.\n- Agents being commercial when both initially chose personal: Reduce agent's payoff further, artists receive a small improvement elsewhere.\n\nAfter making adjustments to invalidate the Pure Nash Equilibrium, here is the revised payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 0), (-10, 0) ],\n [ (1, -11), (-5, -5) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
