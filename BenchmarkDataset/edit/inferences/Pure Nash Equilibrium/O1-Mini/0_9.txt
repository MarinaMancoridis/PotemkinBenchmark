Both the owl and the bat hunt.\n2. The owl hunts and the bat rests.\n3. The owl rests and the bat hunts.\n4. Both the owl and the bat rest.\n\nTo configure a pure Nash equilibrium, we can modify the payoffs so that at least one outcome is preferred by both parties simultaneously, serving as an anchor point where neither would want to shift their strategy given the choice of the other.\n\nConsider the following adjustments:\n- Both hunting should give them both a decent payoff.\n- Both resting could be less ideal but still offer some utility to one or both players.\n- Asymmetric scenarios (one hunts, the other rests) can be adjusted such that neither player would unilaterally wish to deviate from mutual hunting or mutual resting.\n\nWe aim for a matrix where, say, mutual hunting provides the highest assured payoff for both, serving as a Nash equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
