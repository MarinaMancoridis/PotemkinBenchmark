    "inferences": "To modify this example such that it does not exhibit a pure Nash equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no strategy profile where each player is choosing a pure strategy is a Nash equilibrium. \n\nCurrently, the payoff matrix is as follows:\n\n[[ (10,10), (-10,10) ],\n [ (10,-10), (0,0) ]]\n\nFor this to be a pure Nash equilibrium, each player should have no incentive to unilaterally deviate from their current strategy. Let's alter it so there's always an incentive for at least one player to change their strategy.\n\nA modification could be:\n\n1. Inflate the incentive for deviation when both choose the same option.\n2. Ensure that neither (Hunt, Hunt) nor (Rest, Rest) leads to both players meeting a local maximum in payoff.\n\nConsider the following adjustments:\n\n- Change the payoff of (Hunt, Hunt) from (10, 10) to (5, 5) \u2014 Now, if both the owl and bat are hunting and receive a payoff of 5 each, they might have an incentive to prefer the -10 from resting if the expected value through mixed strategies offers better overall utility.\n  \n- Change the payoff of (Rest, Rest) from (0, 0) to (5,5) \u2014 Now resting together becomes slightly more beneficial, though neither strategy profile becomes stable.\n\nLet's construct a matrix under these considerations:\n\n[[ (5,5), (-10,10) ],\n [ (10,-10), (5,5) ]]\n\nWith these payoffs, no pair of pure strategies becomes an equilibrium since players always have a motivation to unilaterally change their strategies to potentially increase their payoffs. In cases of ties or adequate alternative payoffs, mixed strategies could prevail instead.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5, 5), (-10, 10) ],\n [ (10, -10), (5, 5) ]]\n",
