In a Nash equilibrium, given the other player's strategy, a player cannot increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nFirst, let's reassign payoffs for each scenario, ensuring there is at least one pure Nash equilibrium:\n\n1. If both choose serious advice: The king's payoff was -1, the jester was -1. Let's change both to reflect better outcomes if they align on seriousness, say (3,3).\n2. King demands comedy, jester provides comedy: Improve outcomes to ensure at least one stable choice, perhaps (2,2).\n3. King demands comedy, jester provides serious advice: Keep king neutral and heavily penalize the jester, say (0,0).\n4. King demands serious advice, jester performs comedy: Penalize the king significantly but keep the jester neutral, say (0,0).\n\nLet\u2019s set up the revised matrix to include at least one scenario that qualifies as a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
