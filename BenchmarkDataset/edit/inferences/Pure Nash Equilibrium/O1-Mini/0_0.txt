    "inferences": "The concept of a Pure Nash Equilibrium occurs when each player's strategy is a best response to the other player's strategy, meaning neither has anything to gain by changing their strategy unilaterally. In this situation, since each strategy combination results in zero utility (+0 points) for both players, no unilateral change in strategy would yield a better payoff for either player. Thus, every strategy profile is a Nash Equilibrium, including when Dog A chooses \"Fetch\" and Dog B chooses \"Chase\", contradicting the aim of not having a Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\nTo create a game without a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we must ensure no strategy profiles are mutual best responses for the players. We can achieve this by arranging the payoffs such that players always have an incentive to deviate unilaterally.\n\nConsider the new payoff matrix:\n\nPlayer 1: Dog A (Fetch, Stay)\nPlayer 2: Dog B (Chase, Rest)\n\nThe payoffs should be arranged so that changing strategies is always beneficial for one of the dogs:\n\n1. \"Fetch\" & \"Chase\" provides some utility to Dog A but not to Dog B, inducing Dog B to change.\n2. \"Fetch\" & \"Rest\" gives utility to Dog B but not to Dog A, inducing Dog A to change.\n3. \"Stay\" & \"Chase\" benefits Dog B, inducing Dog A to change, and vice versa for Ashen& Rest.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,0), (0,2) ],\n [ (2,0), (0,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
