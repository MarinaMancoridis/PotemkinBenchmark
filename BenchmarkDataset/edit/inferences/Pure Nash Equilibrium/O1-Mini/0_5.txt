A pure Nash equilibrium occurs when each player's strategy is optimal given the other player's strategy.\n\nLet's modify the given scenario so that there is a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nAdjusted Scenario Payoffs:\n1. If both the Advisor and the Postdoc focus on Theoretical Research, they publish a groundbreaking, highly influential paper. (+10 points to each).\n2. If the Advisor wants to focus on Theoretical Research but the Postdoc prefers Applied Research, the Advisor feels dissatisfied with their choice of postdoc (-1 point) and the Postdoc feels neutral about the experience (+0 points).\n3. If the Advisor wants to focus on Applied Research but the Postdoc wants to stick to Theoretical Research, the Postdoc doesn't feel supported in the program (-1 point) but the Advisor feels neutral about progress (+0 points).\n4. If both focus on Applied Research, they create something not very impactful (+5 points each, as it is still considered collaboratively positive).\n\nIn this revised game, both players wanting to focus on Theoretical Research is a Nash equilibrium, as they both receive a better payoff in that case compared to other unilateral changes.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,10), (-1,0) ],\n [ (0,-1), (5,5) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
