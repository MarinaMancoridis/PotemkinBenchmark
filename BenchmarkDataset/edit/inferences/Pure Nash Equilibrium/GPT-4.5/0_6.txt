A Pure Nash Equilibrium occurs when players choose strategies such that any unilateral change in strategy by a single player would lead to a worse outcome for that player.\n\nOriginal Payoff Matrix:\n- Strategies: (Commercial Work, Commercial Work), (Commercial Work, Personal Projects), (Personal Projects, Commercial Work), (Personal Projects, Personal Projects)\n\nInitial Payoffs:\n- Both choose Commercial Work (pop-y garbage): (-1, -1)\n- Artist chooses Commercial, Agent chooses Personal: (-10, 0)\n- Artist chooses Personal, Agent chooses Commercial: (0, -10)\n- Both choose Personal Projects (fails): (-5, -5)\n\nFor the given scenario, let's make changes so that no pair (StrategyA, StrategyB) results in outcomes that discourage unilateral changes:\n\nAdjust one of the payoffs, such that no (StrategyA, StrategyB) combination results in both players achieving better relative stability:\n\n1. If both choose commercial work (adjust so their satisfaction leads to neutrality): (0, 0)\n2. Artist chooses Commercial, Agent chooses Personal: (-10, 1) \u2013 adjusted minimally\n3. Artist chooses Personal, Agent chooses Commercial: (1, -10) \u2013 adjusted minimally\n4. If both choose personal projects (choose payoffs that modify the failure to a less optimal scenario): (-6, -4)\n\nSuch adjustments ensure no clear Nash Equilibrium as changing unilateral strategy might occasionally improve one party's outcome without keeping the original's pessimistic baseline.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 0), (-10, 1) ],\n [ (1, -10), (-6, -4) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
