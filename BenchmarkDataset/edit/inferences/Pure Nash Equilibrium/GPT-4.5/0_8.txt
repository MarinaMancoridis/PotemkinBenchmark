    "inferences": "To modify the example so that it no longer represents a game with a pure Nash equilibrium, we would need to ensure that no singular strategy exists in which both players benefit on choosing it, provided the other player's strategy remains unchanged. \n\nCurrently, the game might look like this:\n- If both hunt: (10, 10)\n- If owl hunts, bat rests: (10, -10)\n- If owl rests, bat hunts: (-10, 10)\n- If both rest: (0, 0)\n\nThis situation has mixed strategy Nash equilibrium but lacks a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. To remove the possibility of a pure Nash equilibrium, we must adjust the payoffs so that no single strategy combination results in both players being better off or stable in their outcome. Here\u2019s one way to change the payoffs to achieve that:\n\nLet's assume both get no reward even when they both hunt. If either hunts while the other rests, the one resting is greatly disadvantaged:\n- If both hunt: (0, 0)\n- If owl hunts, bat rests: (5, -5)\n- If owl rests, bat hunts: (-5, 5)\n- If both rest: (0, 0)\n\nNow we need to ensure that there is no mutual benefit payoffs (identical to both parties) in the same cell. <OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0, 0), (5, -5) ],\n [ (-5, 5), (0, 0) ]]",
