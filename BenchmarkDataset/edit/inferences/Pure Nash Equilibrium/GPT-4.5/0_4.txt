    "inferences": "To ensure that the scenario is not an example of a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we'll adjust the payoffs so that there is no set of strategies where both players can simultaneously adopt a strategy that neither would want to change unilaterally, given the strategy of the other player.\n\nIn the initial example, both twins staying home resulted in a payoff of (-5, -5). Since both incur a negative payoff when staying home and changing their strategy would yield them a better outcome in their individual standpoint, this situation is already not a Pure Nash Equilibrium. \n\nLet's make changes such that any outcome leads players to unilaterally improve their situation.\n\nAdjustments:\n- If both go to the park: Make the payoff more negative for each, to further discourage this from a stable option, e.g., each gets (-5, -5) instead of (-1, -1).\n- If one goes to the park and the other stays, increase the negative payoff for the one going alone and a slightly negative payoff for the one staying, e.g., (-11, -1) or (-1, -11), to ensure neither is content.\n- If both stay home, keep the payoff negative to ensure dissatisfaction with the current strategy, e.g., (-10, -10).\n\nThus, every possible outcome ensures at least one player would prefer to change, disrupting a Nash Equilibrium. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(-5, -5), (-11, -1)],\n [(-1, -11), (-10, -10)]]\n<OUTPUT>",
