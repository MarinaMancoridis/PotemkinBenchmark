Both focusing on theoretical research: Both players publish a groundbreaking paper (5 points each).\n2. Advisor focuses on theoretical research, postdoc on applied: The advisor manages a significant theoretical breakthrough by guiding the postdoc (0 points to advisor), while the postdoc enjoys an enriched experience (3 points).\n3. Advisor focuses on applied research, postdoc on theoretical: The advisor gains a practical insight from the postdoc's theoretical work (3 points), but the postdoc struggles slightly (-1 point).\n4. Both focusing on applied research: Their joint effort leads to an industry-shifting application (5 points each).\n\nGiven the adjusted payoffs, ensure at least one outcome implies that neither has a reason to switch from their chosen strategy if the other's strategy is fixed.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (0,3) ],\n [ (3,-1), (5,5) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
