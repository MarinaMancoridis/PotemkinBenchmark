In this case, the equilibrium should occur when neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their chosen strategy.\n\nLet's adjust the payoff values such that \"Do Nothing\" and \"Prepare the Safety Net\" becomes a Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\n- If the Acrobat does nothing and the Clown prepares the safety net, let's set the payoffs such that the Acrobat gets a slight benefit for resting while the Clown doesn't gain much.\n- If the Acrobat does nothing and the Clown stays idle, nothing optimal happens.\n- If the Acrobat performs a high dive without preparation, it's risky and should not be beneficial.\n- If the Acrobat performs a high dive and the Clown prepares, it would be an impressive act but with costs, perhaps more than when they just rest.\n\nWith these adjustments, the equilibrium where the Acrobat does nothing and the Clown prepares the safety net can be made a stronger choice for both.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,0), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,-1), (2,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
