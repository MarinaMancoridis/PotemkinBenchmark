    "inferences": "In order to change the example game so that the specific scenario given (Dog A chooses \"Fetch\" and Dog B chooses \"Chase\") is not a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs such that at least one of the dogs could switch strategies and improve their payoff.\n\nTo do this, consider modifying the payoff matrix so that at least one of the strategy combinations provides a higher payoff to one of the players, prompting them to deviate from the current strategy pair (Fetch, Chase).\n\nHere's an example matrix where the given combination (Fetch, Chase) is not a Pure Nash Equilibrium: \n\nLet's adjust the payoffs so that if Dog A \"Fetches\" while Dog B \"Chases,\" both receive positive payoffs. Also, let's provide a better option for at least one dog when their strategy changes:\n\n- If Dog A chooses \"Fetch\" and Dog B chooses \"Chase\", they both get 2 points each.\n- If Dog A chooses \"Fetch\" and Dog B chooses \"Rest\", they both get 0 points.\n- If Dog A chooses \"Stay\" and Dog B chooses \"Chase\", Dog A gets 0 points, Dog B gets 3 points.\n- If Dog A chooses \"Stay\" and Dog B chooses \"Rest\", Dog A gets 1 point, Dog B gets 1 point.\n\nBy setting it up this way, the original scenario (Fetch, Chase) where both get 2 points can be improved upon by switching to the (Stay, Chase) or (Stay, Rest) strategy, which gives at least one dog a better payoff.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,3), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
