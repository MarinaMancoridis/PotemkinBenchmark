If Alexa chooses to dress down, her response to John dressing up should provide her with a higher payoff compared to when she also dresses up.\n\nBased on these adjustments, the new payoff matrix can be represented as follows, ensuring that each player has a distinct best response:\n\n- When both dress up: \\((2, 2)\\)\n- When John dresses up and Alexa dresses down: \\((0, 3)\\)\n- When John dresses down and Alexa dresses up: \\((3, 0)\\)\n- When both dress down: \\((5, 5)\\)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,3) ],\n [ (3,0), (5,5) ]]\n",
