In the existing description, Sally writing for an economics audience (in response to Bob) implies a choice that should be a best response. Let's define the options as follows:\n\n- Bob's Options: \"Computer Science\" (CS) or \"Economics\" (Econ)\n- Sally's Options: \"Computer Science\" (CS) or \"Economics\" (Econ)\n\nWe are tasked with defining a payoff matrix that captures these interests such that each of them indeed has one best response strategy. \n\nLet's construct the payoff matrix such that it fulfills the best response criteria, by slightly altering the payoff values to ensure uniqueness in best responses:\n\n1. If both target a \"Computer Science\" audience, Bob's payoff can be higher due to his background, but Sally's payoff should still be non-zero.\n2. If both target an \"Economics\" audience, Sally's payoff will be higher.\n3. If their targeting does not align, both receive zero, indicating rejection.\n\nThe values must be integers and maintain each player's best interest based on these roles.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
