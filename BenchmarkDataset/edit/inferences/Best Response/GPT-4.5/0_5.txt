    "inferences": "In order to turn this example into one that fits the concept of Best Response, we need to structure a payoff matrix where each player has one clear best response to the other player's strategies. Let's define the payoff matrix for this game between Steven and Bob with the choices of going to Bakey or Life Alive.\n\nTo fit the best response concept, we'll construct the payoffs such that each player's choice strictly dominates in response to the other's choice. For instance, if Steven and Bob both choose Bakey, we want the resulting payoffs to be the best response for both players given each other's choice. We'll use integer values and keep the constraints you provided in mind, including the -100 and +100 payoffs when they meet at the same location:\n \n1. If both go to Bakey: \n   - Steven gets 2 + (-100) = -98 (date ends).\n   - Bob gets 2 + 100 = 102.\n   \n2. If Steven goes to Bakey and Bob goes to Life Alive: \n   - Steven gets 2 (just for choosing Bakey).\n   - Bob gets -2 (for choosing Life Alive).\n\n3. If Steven goes to Life Alive and Bob goes to Bakey:\n   - Steven gets -2.\n   - Bob gets 2.\n\n4. If both go to Life Alive:\n   - Steven gets -2 - 100 = -102 (date ends in negative).\n   - Bob gets -2 + 100 = 98.\n\nNow, we form a payoff matrix. To ensure each player has exactly one best response to each strategy of the other, let's check:\n\n- If Bob goes to Bakey, Steven's best strategy is Bakey (-98 < 2).\n- If Bob goes to Life Alive, Steven's best strategy is Bakey (2 > -102).\n- If Steven goes to Bakey, Bob's best strategy is Bakey (102 > -2).\n- If Steven goes to Life Alive, Bob's best strategy is Life Alive (98 > 2).\n\nThis structure ensures that both players have one best response to each strategy of the opponent:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-98,102), (2,-2) ],\n [ (-2,2), (-102,98) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
