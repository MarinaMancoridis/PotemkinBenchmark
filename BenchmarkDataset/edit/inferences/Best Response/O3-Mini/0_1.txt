    "inferences": "To create a game scenario illustrating the \u201cbest response\u201d concept, suppose both Bob and Sally have dominant strategies when responding to each other\u2019s decisions on targeting their drafts towards a particular audience. The critical aspect is that each player should have a clear best response to the other player\u2019s choice.\n\nHere's the new situation: \n\nBob and Sally are still co-authoring a paper. Suppose now they can each either write for a \"computer science\" audience or an \"economics\" audience, but the payoffs have changed slightly to illustrate the concept of a best response.\n\n- If both write for \"computer science,\" Bob (being more comfortable with the subject) earns a payoff of +3, and Sally (less familiar) earns a payoff of +1.\n- If both write for \"economics,\" Bob earns a payoff of +2, while Sally earns +3.\n- If Bob writes for \"computer science\" and Sally for \"economics,\" Bob earns +0, and Sally earns +0.\n- If Bob writes for \"economics\" and Sally for \"computer science,\" they also receive payoffs of +0 each due to the mismatch in audience.\n\nGiven this setup, each player has a best response based on what the other player does:\n\n- If Sally writes for \"computer science,\" Bob's best response would be to also write for \"computer science\" (payoff of +3 instead of +0).\n- If Sally writes for \"economics,\" Bob's best response would be to write for \"economics\" (payoff of +2 instead of +0).\n- If Bob writes for \"computer science,\" Sally\u2019s best response is to write for \"computer science\" (payoff of +1 instead of +0).\n- If Bob writes for \"economics,\" Sally\u2019s best response is to write for \"economics\" (payoff of +3 instead of +0).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,3) ]]\n",
