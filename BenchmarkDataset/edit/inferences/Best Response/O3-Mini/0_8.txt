    "inferences": "To alter the scenario such that it is no longer an instance of the best response concept, we need to introduce a situation where a player's decision does not depend solely on maximizing their payoff given the other player's strategy. Let's modify Alex's preferences so that his response is not a best response.\n\nLet's say now that Alex has a slightly changed motivation: he derives +1 utility from knowing he studied, regardless of whether he passes or fails. Laura's preferences remain unchanged. \n\nConsequently, in this modified case, Alex will always choose to study because he obtains utility from studying irrespective of Laura's action. Laura will continue with her original preference where her utility benefit comes solely from studying. In this modification, neither Alex's nor Laura\u2019s payoffs are based on a best-response strategy to one another.\n\nTherefore, implementing these alterations would prevent Alex's decision from being a best response to Laura\u2019s actions, as his decision is no longer influenced by Laura's strategy but instead determined by an intrinsic reward.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (2,1) ],\n [ (1,2), (0,0) ]]\n",
