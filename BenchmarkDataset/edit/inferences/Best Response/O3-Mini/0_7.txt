    "inferences": "To make this an instance of the game theory concept of Best Response, we need to adjust Anna's utility so that she has a clear best response to Max's choices, and Max has a clear best response to Anna's choices. One way to achieve this is to set their respective payoffs such that when Max chooses a university, Anna has one best response, and vice versa.\n\nLet's modify the utilities:\n\n1. Max derives +100 utility from going to MIT and +50 utility from going to Harvard.\n2. Anna derives +100 utility from going to the opposite university as Max, and -50 utility from attending the same university as Max.\n\nIn such a situation, Anna will always choose the opposite university of Max to maximize her utility. \n\nFor Max, if Anna chooses MIT, his best response, given his higher utility from MIT, is to also choose MIT. If Anna chooses Harvard, Max will choose MIT for a higher payoff.\n\nNow, let's translate these utilities into a payoff matrix:\n\nLet's create the payoff matrix for both players:\n\n- If both choose MIT: Max (100), Anna (-50)\n- If Max chooses MIT and Anna chooses Harvard: Max (100), Anna (100)\n- If Max chooses Harvard and Anna chooses MIT: Max (50), Anna (100)\n- If both choose Harvard: Max (50), Anna (-50)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (100,-50), (100,100) ],\n [ (50,100), (50,-50) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
