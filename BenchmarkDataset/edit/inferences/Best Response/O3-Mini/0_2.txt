    "inferences": "To ensure the provided scenario is no longer an example of the \"Best Response\" concept in game theory, we will modify the payoffs so that a player has more than one best response to the opponent's strategy. This can be done by altering the payoffs such that the best response to at least one of the opponent's strategies is no longer unique.\n\nOriginal game:\n- Both dress down: payoff is (5, 5)\n- Both dress up: payoff is (2, 2)\n- One dresses up, and the other dresses down: payoff is (-10, -10)\n\nTo make the scenario not a best response, modify the payoffs:\n- Both dress down: payoff is still (5, 5)\n- Both dress up: change payoff to (3, 3) so that dressing up is also a potential best response to dressing down.\n- One dresses up, and the other dresses down: modify payoff from (-10) to make it neutral (0) so it doesn't dominate.\n\nNow, both dressing down and dressing up are responses to each other dressing down, hence there won't be a unique best response, breaking the best response criteria. Let's define this in a payoff matrix.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (3,3) ],\n [ (0,0), (3,3) ]]\n",
