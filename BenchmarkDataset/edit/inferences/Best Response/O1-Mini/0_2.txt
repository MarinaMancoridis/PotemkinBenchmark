Let's adjust the payoffs to create a scenario where multiple responses could be equally viable. \n\nOriginally, the game looked like this:\n\n- Dress Up/Dress Up: (2, 2)\n- Dress Up/Dress Down or Dress Down/Dress Up: (-10, -10)\n- Dress Down/Dress Down: (5, 5)\n\nLet's change the game as follows so best responses might not be distinct:\n\n- Dress Up/Dress Up: (2, 2)\n- Dress Up/Dress Down: (-10, 4)\n- Dress Down/Dress Up: (4, -10)\n- Dress Down/Dress Down: (5, 5)\n\nIn this modification, if Alexa dressed down and John dressed up, Alexa would prefer to dress up too, increasing her payoff compared to that of dressing down. This scenario offers no single best response for each player against another's strategy, as neither has a consistent payoff preference for one strategy over another due to mixed incentives.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 2), (-10, 4) ],\n [ (4, -10), (5, 5) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
