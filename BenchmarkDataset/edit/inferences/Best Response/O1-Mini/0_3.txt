    "inferences": "To transform the given scenario into one that demonstrates the concept of best response, we need to construct a payoff matrix where each player\u2014John and Alexa\u2014has exactly one best response to each possible strategy of their opponent.\n\nFirst, let's outline the conditions:\n\n1. When both choose to dress up: This must be a mutual best response, meaning the payoffs make it advantageous for them both if the other chooses the same strategy. However, in the original example, both getting a payoff of +2 implies that dressing up, although uncomfortable, is still beneficial mutually, but does not demonstrate a clear best response as both have better responses in certain situations.\n\n2. When one dresses up and the other dresses down: Here, the awkward payout of -10 doesn't result in a best response if the opposite occurs. We must adjust this to prevent them from selecting the opposing strategy when one is fixed.\n\n3. When both dress down: This situation is quite similar to both dressing up; however, it needs a bit of tweaking to lock one of their choices into a best response, forcing a different decision where appropriate.\n\nTo meet these criteria, we'll ensure each entry reflects a best response given the other player's choice:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (1,1), (2,2) ],\n [ (3,0), (0,3) ]]\n\n",
