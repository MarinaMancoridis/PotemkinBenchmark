    "inferences": "To modify the example to fit the concept of \"Best Response,\" we need to ensure that each player (Max and Anna) has exactly one best response to every possible strategy of their opponent. \n\nLet's create a scenario where Max derives utility based on his preference for MIT in general, and Anna derives utility based on being at a different location from Max. We will assign the utility values such that the best response for both Max and Anna leads to distinct strategies.\n\nFor instance:\n- If Max chooses Harvard, he receives 0 utility; if he chooses MIT, he receives 100 utility.\n- If Anna chooses Harvard when Max is at MIT, she receives 100 utility; if she chooses MIT when Max is at Harvard, she receives 100 utility.\n- Anna will receive -50 utility for being at the same university as Max due to her dislike of him.\n\nIn this manner, each choice of Max prompts Anna's best response to be the opposite university, and vice versa.\n\nLet's present this as a payoff matrix where each cell represents the utility for [Max, Anna].\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,-50), (100,100) ],\n [ (100,100), (0,-50) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
