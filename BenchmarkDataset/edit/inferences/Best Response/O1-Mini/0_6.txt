For example, if Anna derives the same utility regardless of whether she is at the same university as Max or not, then her choice won't be a response to Max's decision.\n\nLet's articulate this adjustment:\n\nMax still derives +100 utility from attending MIT and 0 utility from Harvard. However, Anna now derives 0 utility from being at either the same or a different university than Max.\n\nAccordingly, with these adjusted preferences, choosing a university does not constitute a best response for Anna to Max's choice.  \n\nLet's create a new payoff matrix that reflects this adjustment while ensuring that no player has a single best response to each of their opponent's strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (100, 0), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 100), (0, 0) ]]",
