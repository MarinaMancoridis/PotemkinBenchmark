Suppose now that if both write for a computer science audience, Bob gets a payoff of +3 while Sally receives +3 as well\u2014reflecting that both increased their efforts in understanding the other's field. Now, if both write for an economics audience, Bob gets a payoff of +1 while Sally's payoff becomes +3, as she values consistency over field knowledge in this scenario.\n\nHere's how they could resemble in an altered payoff matrix where each player no longer has a single best response to every strategy:\n\n- Both opt for a Computer Science audience: Bob gets +3, Sally gets +3.\n- Sally opts for an Economics audience, and Bob for a Computer Science audience: Both get 0.\n- Bob opts for an Economics audience, and Sally for a Computer Science audience: Both get 0.\n- Both opt for an Economics audience: Bob gets +1, Sally gets +3.\n\nIn this scenario, each player's payoff no longer leads to having a unique best response for each strategy of the opponent.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
