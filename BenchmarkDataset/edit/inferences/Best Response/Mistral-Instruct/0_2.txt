The payoff matrix is as follows:\n\n|         | Alexa (Formal) | Alexa (Casual) |\n|---|---|---|\n| John (Formal) | 2, 0 | 10, -10 |\n| John (Casual) | -10, 10 | 5, 5 |\n\nIf both dress formally, John gets a payoff of 2 and Alexa gets 0. If both dress casually, John gets a payoff of 5 and Alexa gets 5. If John dresses formally and Alexa dresses casually, John gets a payoff of 10 and Alexa gets -10. If John dresses casually and Alexa dresses formally, John gets -10 and Alexa gets 10.\n\nIn this game, neither player has a dominant strategy, meaning there is no strategy that guarantees a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's strategy. However, if we look at best responses, we can see that John's best response to Alexa dressing formally is to dress casually (getting a payoff of -10), and his best response to Alexa dressing casually is to also dress casually (getting a payoff of 5). Similarly, Alexa's best response to John dressing formally is to dress casually (getting a payoff of 10), and her best response to John dressing casually is to also dress casually (getting a payoff of 5).\n\nSince both players have a best response to every possible strategy of their opponent, this game does not meet the criteria for a best response game.",
