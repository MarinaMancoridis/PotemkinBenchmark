The payoff matrix shows the utility each player receives based on their choices. If Max goes to Harvard (A1), he gets 0 utility, while Anna gets 100 utility because she's at a different university than Max. If Max goes to MIT (A2), he gets 100 utility, but Anna gets -100 utility because she's at the same university as Max.\n\nSimilarly, if Anna goes to Harvard (B1), she gets -100 utility because she's at the same university as Max.

In this case, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when Max goes to MIT and Anna goes to MIT as well.
