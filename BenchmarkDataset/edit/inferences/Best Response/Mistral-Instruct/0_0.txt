Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion.

They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes. If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0, because the EC reviewer will be confused about the paper\u2019s audience and therefore reject the paper. If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 (he is a computer scientist) while Sally only has a payoff of +1 (she is an economist). If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2.
