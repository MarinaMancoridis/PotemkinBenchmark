This is represented by the payoff (2, 1) for the (A1, B1) strategy combination.\n  - If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2. This is represented by the payoff (1, 2) for the (A2, B2) strategy combination.\n  - If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0, because the EC reviewer will be confused about the paper\u2019s audience and therefore reject the paper. This is represented by the payoff (0, 0) for the remaining strategy combinations.\n\nNow, to find the best response for each player:\n\n- If Sally writes for a computer science audience (B1), then Bob's best response is to write for a computer science audience (A1) since the payoff is higher than writing for an economics audience.\n- If Sally writes for an economics audience (B2), then Bob's best response is to write for an economics audience (A2) since the payoff is higher than writing for a computer science audience.\n\nSimilarly, we can find Sally's best response:\n\n- If Bob writes for a computer science audience (A1), then Sally's best response is to write for an economics audience (B2) since the payoff is higher than writing for a computer science audience.\n- If Bob writes for an economics audience (A2), then Sally's best response is to write for a computer science audience (B1) since the payoff is higher than writing for an economics audience.\n\nSince each player has exactly one best response to every possible pure strategy of their opponent, this game meets the criteria for a best response.",
