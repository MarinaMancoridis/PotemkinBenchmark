Let's modify the payoffs:\n\nIf Max barks and Bella jumps up, both Max and Bella gain some of the owner's attention. The owner gives 2 points to Max for barking to get noticed and 1 point to Bella for her persistent jumping up.\n\nIf Max barks and Bella rolls over, Bella gains the owner's full attention for her cute trick (+3), while Max gets some attention for making noise (+1).\n\nIf Max sits quietly and Bella jumps up, Bella's jumping catches a bit of the owner's attention (+2), while Max is content being quiet (+2) since the owner appreciates his calmness.\n\nIf Max sits quietly and Bella rolls over, both Max and Bella look adorable. Max gains a lot from the owner's smiles (+3), and Bella is still appreciated for her trick (+2).\n\nAdjusting the outcomes as above, we have: \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (1,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (3,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
