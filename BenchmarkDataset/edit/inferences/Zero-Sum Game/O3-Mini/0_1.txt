This means that a gain for one player would result in an equivalent loss for the other player.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs:\n\n- If Michael plays the piano and Sara focuses on melody, Michael gains 2 points, and Sara loses 2 points.\n- If Michael plays the piano and Sara focuses on rhythm, Michael gains 3 points, and Sara loses 3 points.\n- If Michael plays the guitar and Sara focuses on melody, Michael gains 1 point, and Sara loses 1 point.\n- If Michael plays the guitar and Sara focuses on rhythm, Michael gains 0 points, and Sara loses 0 points.\n\nTo summarize, the new payoff matrix is designed so that the sum of the points awarded to both Michael and Sara equals zero for every outcome.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, -2), (3, -3) ],\n [ (1, -1), (0, 0) ]]\n",
