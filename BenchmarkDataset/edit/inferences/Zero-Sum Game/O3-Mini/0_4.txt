A zero-sum game is one where the gain of one player is exactly balanced by the loss of the other player. Instead, let's create a scenario where both can gain or lose simultaneously, or the sum of gains and losses is not zero.\n\nThe modified outcomes are as follows:\n\n1. If the advisor focuses on research updates and Alex asks about career advice, the advisor feels somewhat informed (+1), and Alex receives valuable advice that helps her feel prepared (+1).\n   \n2. If the advisor focuses on research updates and Alex asks for help with coding, the advisor becomes aware of Alex\u2019s technical issues and helps solve a major bug (+2), while Alex makes significant progress on her coding project (+1).\n   \n3. If the advisor discusses conference deadlines and Alex asks about career advice, the advisor efficiently plans upcoming conferences (+2), and Alex gains useful insights into her career (+1).\n   \n4. If the advisor discusses conference deadlines and Alex asks for help with coding, they exchange creative ideas that lead to new opportunities even though coding isn't directly addressed (+1 for each).\n\nThis creates a non-zero-sum game where both players can simultaneously win or lose, or the gains/losses do not add up to zero.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (2,1) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,1) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
