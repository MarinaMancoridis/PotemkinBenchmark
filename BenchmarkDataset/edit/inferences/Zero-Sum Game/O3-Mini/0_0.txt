    "inferences": "To modify this game so it is no longer a zero-sum game, we'll adjust the payoffs such that the total payoff is not necessarily zero for every combination of strategies. In a zero-sum game, one player's gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss. To break this condition, we can introduce outcomes where the total payoff is not constant.\n\nFor example, let's assume some scenarios that could alter the payoff structure:\n\n1. If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks upwards, Artemis receives 2 points because she executes a clean shot over Georgia's block, while Georgia gains 0 points.\n\n2. If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia swats the ball away and maintains 1 point for successfully blocking, whereas Artemis receives -1 for a failed attempt.\n\n3. If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks upwards, Artemis scores 3 points as she skillfully maneuvers around Georgia's block, while Georgia doesn't gain any points.\n\n4. If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia exceptionally blocks and gains 2 points for a surprising defense, while Artemis receives -2 points for failure to score.\n\nThese outcomes ensure that the game is no longer zero-sum as the total payoffs vary.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,0), (-1,1) ],\n [ (3,0), (-2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
