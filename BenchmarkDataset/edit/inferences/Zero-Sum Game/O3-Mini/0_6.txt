    "inferences": "To change the game so that it is not a zero-sum game, we need to adjust the payoffs such that the sum of the payoffs between Emma and Olivia for each outcome does not always equal zero. In a zero-sum game, what one player gains, the other loses in equal measure, making the sum of their payoffs zero for all strategy combinations.\n\nHere's a modified version of the game where it's not a zero-sum game:\n\n1. If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia sings a song, Emma wows her audience (+3) and Olivia feels embarrassed (-1).\n2. If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia draws a picture, the parents appreciate both the trick and the artwork (+2 for Emma and +2 for Olivia).\n3. If Emma tells a joke and Olivia sings a song, Olivia gains confidence (+1) and Emma gains slightly positive attention (+2).\n4. If Emma tells a joke and Olivia draws a picture, both enjoy a good reaction from the family (+1 to each).\n\nThis adjustment introduces non-zero-sum characteristics by allowing scenarios where both players can gain or lose simultaneously without the sum of outcomes being zero.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,-1), (2,2) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
