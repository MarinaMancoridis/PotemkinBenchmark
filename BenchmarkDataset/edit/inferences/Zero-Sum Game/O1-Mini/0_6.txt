Emma gets a payoff of +2 and Olivia +1.\n\n- If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia draws a picture, both appreciate each other's talents, Emma receives +1, and Olivia receives +2.\n\n- If Emma tells a joke and Olivia sings a song, Emma gains confidence despite the outcome with a payoff of +0, and Olivia gets +2 due to applause.\n\n- If Emma tells a joke and Olivia draws a picture, both gain attention for their creativity.
