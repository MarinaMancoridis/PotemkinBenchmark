Max gets +1 and Bella gets +1.\n- If Max barks and Bella rolls over, Bella gains the owner's attention for her cute trick (+2 for Bella), while Max loses the opportunity (-1 for Max).\n- If Max sits quietly and Bella jumps up, Bella gets love (+2) and Max avoids any penalty or gain (0 for Max).\n- If Max sits quietly and Bella rolls over, Max gets some attention (+1) and Bella also manages to get noticed slightly (+1 for both).\n\nLet's create a 2x2 payoff matrix for this adjusted scenario.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (-1,2) ],\n [ (0,2), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
