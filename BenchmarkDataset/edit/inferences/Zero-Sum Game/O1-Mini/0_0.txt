Artemis gains nothing, but Georgia gains a point for a successful defensive play.\n- If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks upwards, Artemis succeeds in shooting past Georgia, hence scores a point for gameplay while Georgia gains nothing.\n- If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia successfully blocks again, gaining a point while Artemis gains nothing.\n\nThese changes ensure that the total payoff is not zero in some outcomes, thus this is not a zero-sum game.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,0), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (0,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
