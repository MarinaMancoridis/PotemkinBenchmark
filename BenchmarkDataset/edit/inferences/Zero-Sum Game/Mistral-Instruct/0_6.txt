The payoffs represent the change in happiness for each player based on the strategies they choose.\n\nFor example, if Emma tells a story and Olivia draws a picture, Emma gains 3 points and Olivia loses 1 point. If both Emma and Olivia tell stories, they both receive 0 points, and if both draw pictures, there is no change in happiness for either player.\n\nThis game is not a zero-sum game because the total sum of payoffs is not always zero. For instance, when Emma tells a story and Olivia draws a picture, the total change in happiness is 3 - 1 = 2, which is not equal to 0.",
