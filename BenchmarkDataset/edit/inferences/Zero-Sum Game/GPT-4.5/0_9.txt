    "inferences": "To make this game an instance of a Zero-Sum Game, we need to adjust the payoffs so that one player's gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss. Let's adjust the presented payoffs to meet this requirement while keeping similar logic to the scenario:\n\n1. When a professor lectures and a student studies, we'll keep it as: the professor gets +2 points and the student gets -2 points.\n2. When a professor lectures and a student listens, to make it zero-sum, let's set: the professor gets +1 point and the student gets -1 point.\n3. When a professor advises and a student studies, we adjust it to zero-sum by giving: the professor gets +3 points and the student gets -3 points.\n4. When a professor advises and the student listens, let's give both -1 and +1 points to make the net effect zero-sum, so: the professor gets 0 points and the student gets 0 points (no gains or losses).\n\nNow, constructing the 2x2 payoff matrix to reflect this new zero-sum game scenario:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,-2), (1,-1) ],\n [ (3,-3), (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
