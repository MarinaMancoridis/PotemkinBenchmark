    "inferences": "To modify the scenario so that it does not represent a zero-sum game, we can change the payoff structure such that the sum of outcomes for all strategy pairs is not always zero. In a zero-sum game, the payoff gained by one player is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the payoff lost by the other player. Thus, altering the outcomes to have varying payoffs where the sum isn't zero will make it a non-zero-sum game.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs for each combination of strategies:\n\n1. If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks upwards, instead of neither scoring, Artemis could get a slight advantage by making a strategic move, leading to a payoff like (1, 2) for both players.\n2. If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks downwards, and Georgia blocks it effectively, Georgia not only stops the shot but gets a further defensive reputation, resulting in a payoff like (0, 3).\n3. If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks upwards, Artemis could find a way to eventually score, leading to a payoff like (3, 0).\n4. If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks downwards, we could assume some error in blocking, allowing for a scenario of (2, 1).\n\nThis way, we ensure the game is not zero-sum by providing varying payoffs that do not sum to zero across the strategies. So, the corresponding payoff matrix change is:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1, 2), (0, 3) ],\n [ (3, 0), (2, 1) ]]\n",
