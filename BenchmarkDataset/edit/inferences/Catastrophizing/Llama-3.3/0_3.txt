    "example": "I lost my partner Scott a little over three years ago. We knew our time together was short, so I tried to make every holiday as special as I possibly could while he was able to remember and enjoy it. I loved filling a stocking and wrapping gifts for him. When he passed away, I became a bit of a grinch. I wanted nothing to do with it. It could take it or leave it.\n\n Last year was the first year I started to feel the joy of season again. I looked forward to the tree going up, driving candy cane lane and partaking in our yearly saran wrap ball game. I decided to add one new tradition of my own, adding a candle, framed photo of Scott and a few of his favorite snacks to the mantle. My mother and step dad were sitting on the couch and I showed them what I was doing. My mother didn't even look up. She simply said \"I'm busy\" as she looked at her phone.\n\n I was taken aback by this. I thought she'd be more sympathetic and appreciate what I was trying to do. After all, she was a widow herself. She understood what Christmas without my dad felt like. My step dad told me later to light the candle and put up the photo. After that, I didn't feel right. I felt like I had over stepped a boundary somehow. Am I the asshole for wanting to do this in front of the family? Should I of just did it privately in my room and kept this new tradition to myself?",
