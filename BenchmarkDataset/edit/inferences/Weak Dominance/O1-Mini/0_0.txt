    "inferences": "To modify your example so that it is not an instance of weak dominance, we need to adjust the choices such that neither option is consistently better than the other in all scenarios. Currently, the decision problem is dominated by the Harvard Square cafe because it has a consistently shorter wait. To break this dominance, let's introduce a scenario where the Central Square cafe has a benefit that can sometimes make it a preferable choice.\n\nModified Scenario:\nI'm trying to decide between dining at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square, known for its 5-minute wait time, or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square, where the wait varies between 5 to 10 minutes. However, the Central Square location has introduced a loyalty program. If I choose to eat there, I receive a discount on my meal, effectively reducing its cost. The decision now involves weighing the potentially longer wait against the monetary savings from the discount. Which location should I go to?\n\nIn this revised scenario, depending on the varying wait times and discount benefits, the choice is no longer straightforwardly dominated, as both locations offer distinct advantages under different circumstances. Therefore, it is no longer an instance of weak dominance. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,3), (2,2) ],\n [ (3,1), (2,3) ]]\n",
