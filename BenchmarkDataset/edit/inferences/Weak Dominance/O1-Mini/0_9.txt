Weak dominance in game theory occurs when a strategy provides a payoff that is at least as good as another strategy in all situations and strictly better in at least one situation.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs to allow for weak dominance while retaining the context of the decision-making process.\n\nAssume Player 1 represents \"my firm\" and Player 2 represents \"the competitor firm.\" We will create a payoff matrix where:\n\n1. Not advertising weakly dominates advertising for Player 1.\n2. Not advertising weakly dominates advertising for Player 2.\n\nCurrent scenario payoff without advertising costs:\n- Both advertise: (30,30)\n- One advertises: (50,0) or (0,50)\n- Neither advertises: (10,10)\n\nLet's apply advertising costs, leading to an initial payoff matrix:\n- Both advertise: (-5,-5) = (30-35, 30-35)\n- One advertises: (15,-35) or (-35,15) = (50-35, 0-35)\n- Neither advertises: (10,10)\n\nTo achieve weak dominance, adjust payoffs slightly:\n\n1. Reduce the payoff for advertising when the opponent doesn't advertise to a point where not advertising becomes weakly dominant.\n\nLet's create such a payoff matrix:\n\n- Both advertise: (-5,-5)\n- My firm advertises, competitor doesn't: (5,10)\n- My firm doesn't advertise, competitor does: (10,5)\n- Neither advertises: (10,10)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-5,-5), (5,10) ],\n [ (10,5), (10,10) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
