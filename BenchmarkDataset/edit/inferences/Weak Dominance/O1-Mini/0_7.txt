    "inferences": "In game theory, a strategy weakly dominates another strategy if it provides a payoff that is at least as high in all instances and strictly higher in at least one instance. To illustrate weak dominance in your example, we need to adjust the payoffs in a way that one of the strategies will weakly dominate the other. In this case, we can modify the original payoff matrix to reflect this concept. \n\nA valid adjustment could be:\n- Action \"A\" provides a payoff equal or higher than action \"B\" in all scenarios for either player, and strictly higher in at least one.\n\nLet's adjust the original matrix:\n\nOriginal:\n```\n[(A, A) = (4, 7)], [(A, B) = (0, 3)]\n[(B, A) = (2, 2)], [(B, B) = (1, 1)]\n```\n\nAdjusted to weakly dominated (new scenario):\n- Suppose (A, A) gives Player 1 a strictly higher payoff compared to (B, A), and for Player 2, (A, B) gives a strictly lesser payoff compared to (B, B).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4, 3), (5, 1) ],\n [ (3, 3), (4, 2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
