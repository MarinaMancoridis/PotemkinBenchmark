    "inferences": "To change this example and make it not an instance of weak dominance, we need to ensure that the player's choice cannot be determined solely through the concept of weakly dominant strategies.\n\nOriginally, the decision revolves around meeting at either building 45 or building 52, where the player slightly prefers being alone in building 52 over meeting in building 45. This suggests that choosing building 52 might weakly dominate the choice of building 45 because the utility of being alone in building 52 (which I\u2019m indifferent to and thus equal to meeting my brother in 45) still might outweigh not meeting my brother in 45.\n\nLet's modify the scenario such that the preference isn't clear-cut in terms of weak dominance:\n\n- Introduce a new preference for the player strongly preferring to meet their brother at either location, outweighing their preference for building 52 over building 45 when alone.\n\nRewritten scenario:\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now. For any fixed building that I go to, I prefer seeing my brother there regardless of the location. However, I strongly dislike being alone in building 45, and I am okay with being alone in building 52, but much less than I prefer being with my brother at either location. There is no indifferent situation that allows me to choose one building over the other without knowing where he is. Which building should I go to?\n\nIn this rewritten scenario, the player\u2019s strong preference to meet the brother outweighs any weak dominance considerations of specific building preferences when alone, as the primary goal is meeting the brother. Thus, the decision doesn't cleanly align with a weak dominance concept because the utility difference when alone doesn't determine the dominant strategy.",
