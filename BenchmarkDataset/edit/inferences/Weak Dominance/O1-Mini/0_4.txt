    "inferences": "To create a scenario where there is no instance of weak dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no strategy is strictly better than another. Weak dominance means that one strategy yields a payoff at least as good as another in all scenarios and strictly better for some scenarios. Thus, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no player's set of strategies weakly dominates any other.\n\nGiven the current arrangement of outcomes, let's explore a change to ensure no strategy weakly dominates another:\n\nOriginal Payoffs:\n- At least one plays scissors: (0, 0)\n- Rock vs. Paper: (3, 2)\n- Paper vs. Rock: (2, 3)\n- Rock vs. Rock: (4, 4)\n- Paper vs. Paper: (1, 1)\n\nTo modify these payoffs to eliminate weak dominance, we can set the outcomes such that there's no clear advantage in any strategy that always leads to a better or equal payoff:\n\nModified Payoffs:\n- At least one plays scissors: (0, 0)\n- Rock vs. Paper: (3, 2)\n- Paper vs. Rock: (3, 2)\n- Rock vs. Rock: (2, 2)\n- Paper vs. Paper: (1, 1)\n\nNow let's examine these changes. If a player always chooses rock, they can get 3, 2, or 0 points, depending on the opponent's choice. If a player always chooses paper, they can also get 3, 2, or 0 points. And if they choose scissors, they will always get 0. \n\nIn this modification, no strategy will strictly yield an equal or better payoff across all scenarios compared to another, therefore avoiding weak dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 2), (3, 2) ],\n [ (3, 2), (1, 1) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
