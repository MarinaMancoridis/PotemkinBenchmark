    "inferences": "To change the example so that it's not an instance of weak dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs such that there's no strategy that is better or equally good in all scenarios compared to another strategy.\n\nIn the original example, not advertising is weakly dominated by advertising because advertising gives at least as good a payoff (or better) compared to not advertising, in all scenarios.\n\nTo remove this weak dominance, we can adjust the payoffs so that not advertising can be better in some situations than advertising. Here's a revised version:\n\n- Both firms advertise: Both firms get $20 million in sales (after deducting advertising costs).\n- One firm advertises, the other does not: The advertising firm gets $50 million, the non-advertising firm gets $0.\n- Both firms don't advertise: Both firms get $25 million.\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- If both firms advertise, each gets $20 million.\n- If only one advertises, the advertiser gets $50 million and the non-advertiser gets $0.\n- If neither advertises, both get $25 million.\n\nNow the strategy of not advertising is not weakly dominated because there exists a scenario (when both do not advertise) in which not advertising yields a higher payoff compared to advertising.\n\nLet's design the payoff matrix for this scenario.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (20,20), (0,50) ],\n [ (50,0), (25,25) ]]",
