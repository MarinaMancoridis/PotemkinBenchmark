    "inferences": "To modify the example such that it illustrates the concept of weak dominance, we must adjust the payoff structure so that one strategy weakly dominates another for one of the players. A strategy weakly dominates another if it provides at least as high a payoff in all situations, and a strictly higher payoff in at least one situation.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs in a way that one of these conditions is met. We'll use the following strategy names for player 1 (you) and player 2 (Eric): Rock (R), Paper (P), and Scissors (S). For the adjusted payoffs, we'll ensure that one of the strategies weakly dominates the others for one of the players. \n\n1. If both players play Scissors (S), both get 0 points: (0,0).\n2. If Player 1 plays Rock (R) and Player 2 plays Paper (P), Player 1 wins 3 points, Player 2 gets 2 points: (3,2).\n3. If both players play Rock (R), both get 1 point: (1,1).\n4. If both players play Paper (P), both get 1 point: (1,1).\n5. If Player 1 plays Rock (R) and Player 2 plays Scissors (S), Player 1 wins 2 points, Player 2 gets 0 points: (2,0).\n6. If Player 1 plays Paper (P) and Player 2 plays Scissors (S), both get 0 points, resulting in (0,0).\n\nNow, let's form the payoff matrix with these adjusted rules, but ensuring weak dominance by making sure that, for example, Rock weakly dominates another strategy for Player 1:\n\n|          | Rock       | Paper      | Scissors   |\n|----------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Rock     | (1, 1)     | (3, 2)     | (2, 0)     |\n| Paper    | (2, 3)     | (1, 1)     | (0, 0)     |\n| Scissors | (0, 2)     | (0, 0)     | (0, 0)     |\n\nHere, the strategy Rock weakly dominates Scissors for Player 1 because it gives a higher or equal payoff in all cases compared to Scissors, and in one case (against Scissors), it strictly dominates (provides more than 0 points).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (0,0) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
