The objective is to meet at one of the two buildings (45 or 52).\n\n|                 | Building 45 | Building 52 |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Building 45      | (0,0)      | (1,1)      |\n| Building 52      | (1,1)      | (0,0)      |\n\nIn this matrix, the payoff for Player 1 (you) is represented by the first number in each cell, and the payoff for Player 2 (your brother) is represented by the second number.\n\nThe (0,0) payoff means that both players end up at the same building, but it doesn't matter to you (Player 1) because you just want to find your brother. The (1,1) payoff means that both players end up at different buildings, but this is not desirable for either player since you both want to meet.\n\nNow, to find the strategy that dominates the other under the weak dominance criterion, we look for a strategy that guarantees a better payoff regardless of the opponent's strategy. In this case, there is no such strategy, as both strategies have the same payoff when you consider only your own payoff (Player 1's payoff).\n\nHowever, if we were to consider the strong dominance criterion, where a strategy dominates if it guarantees a better payoff for both players, then we can see that both strategies are dominated by the strategy where both players end up at different buildings (Building 45 and Building 52). But since we are looking for weak dominance, this is not the case here.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (1,1) ],\n [ (1,1), (0,0) ]]",
