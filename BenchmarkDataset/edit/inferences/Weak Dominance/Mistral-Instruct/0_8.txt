Firm 1 gets $50 million in sales, and Firm 2 gets no sales.\n- A3 = A4 = 10: Both firms do not advertise, and both firms get $10 million in sales.\n- A1, A2, A3, A4 are all non-negative integers representing the payoffs for Firm 1, and B1, B2, B3, B4 are all non-negative integers representing the payoffs for Firm 2.\n\nIn this game, there is no dominant strategy for either player, as neither strategy strictly dominates the other.
