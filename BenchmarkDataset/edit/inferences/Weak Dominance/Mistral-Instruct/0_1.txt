Strategy 1: Dine at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square (H)\n2. Strategy 2: Dine at the Life Alive cafe in Central Square (C)\n\nSince the wait time in Harvard Square is always 5 minutes, we can set the payoff for Player 1 (you) as 5 for Strategy 1.\n\nFor Strategy 2, the wait time in Central Square varies between 3 and 10 minutes. Let's assume the average wait time is 6 minutes. Set the payoff for Player 1 as 6 for Strategy 2.\n\nSince we are looking for the Weak Dominance, we want to find a strategy that is better than all other strategies for at least one outcome.\n\nIn this case, Strategy 1 (Harvard Square) is always better than Strategy 2 (Central Square) because the wait time is guaranteed to be 5 minutes or less, while the wait time in Central Square can be as high as 10 minutes.\n\nHere is the payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (5, 6), (5, 6) ],\n [ (?, ?), (?, ?) ]]\n\nSince Strategy 1 is Weakly Dominant, it doesn't matter what the payoffs for the other outcomes are.\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (5, 6), (5, 6) ],\n [ (?, ?), (?, ?) ]]",
