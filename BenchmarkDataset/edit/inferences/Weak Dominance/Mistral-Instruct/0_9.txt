The rows represent the strategies of Firm 1 (advertise or not), and the columns represent the strategies of Firm 2 (advertise or not). The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs (in millions of dollars) for each firm.\n\nIn this game, if both firms advertise, they both get $30 million dollars in sales (A1, B1). If one firm advertises but the other firm does not, then the firm that advertises gets $50 million in sales, and the other firm gets no sales (A2, B1). If both firms don't advertise, then both firms get $10 million dollars in sales (A1, B2). The cost of advertising is $35 million for each firm.\n\nAccording to the concept of Weak Dominance, a strategy is weakly dominant if it is better than all other strategies for a player, regardless of what the other player does. In this game, if Firm 1 does not advertise (strategy A4), it will always get a payoff of $10 million, which is less than the payoff of $30 million it gets if both firms advertise (strategy A1). Similarly, if Firm 2 does not advertise (strategy B2), it will always get a payoff of $10 million, which is less than the payoff of $30 million it gets if both firms advertise (strategy B1).\n\nTherefore, based on the Weak Dominance concept, both firms should advertise, as it is the best strategy for both firms, regardless of what the other firm does. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified model, and in real-world scenarios, other factors such as market saturation, brand loyalty, and advertising effectiveness may also play a role in the firms' decisions.",
