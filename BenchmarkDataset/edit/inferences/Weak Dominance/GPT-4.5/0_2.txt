In game theory, a strategy weakly dominates another if it provides at least as good a payoff in all circumstances and a strictly better payoff in some cases. Here\u2019s how the scenario could be adjusted:\n\n---\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died, and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now. For any fixed building that I go to, I\u2019d prefer to see my brother there than to not see him there. I am indifferent between being alone in building 45 and being alone in building 52, but I still prefer to meet my brother if he\u2019s at either of those buildings. Which building should I go to?\n\n---\n\nIn this version, there's no clear preference for one building over the other when alone, making it not a case of weak dominance because the choice doesn't strictly improve the outcome in some cases while being equal in others, considering the possible outcomes without seeing the brother. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (1,2) ],\n [ (2,1), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
