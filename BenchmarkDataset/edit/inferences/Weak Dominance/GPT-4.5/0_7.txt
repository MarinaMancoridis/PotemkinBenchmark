In weak dominance, one strategy provides a payoff that is at least as good for a player as another strategy, and strictly better in at least one situation. We'll modify the payoff matrix accordingly to fit this definition:\n\n- Keep action (A, A) leading to payoffs (4, 7).\n- Adjust action (A, B) to allow weak dominance, such that (A, B) has an equal or better payoff than (B, B) for each player.\n- For (B, A) and (B, B), adjust to show that they aren't strictly dominated by (A, A). \n\nLet's set these conditions by assigning integers that maintain payoff validity while showing weak dominance:\n\n- Set (A, B) to have slightly higher or equal values compared to (B, B), to demonstrate weak dominance.\n  \n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,7), (1,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,1) ]]\n",
