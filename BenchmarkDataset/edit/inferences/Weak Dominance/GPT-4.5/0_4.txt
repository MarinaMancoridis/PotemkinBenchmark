    "inferences": "To modify the game so that there is no weakly dominant strategy, we need to adjust the payoff structure. In the original scenario, the key is to have no strategy that always results in an equal or higher payoff regardless of what the other player does. \n\nLet's adjust the game-play rules. We'll set up a new payoff matrix that does not exhibit weak dominance. The goal is to make sure that each player's strategy choice depends on the choice of the other player, leading to no strategy being weakly dominant.\n\nConsider the modified payoffs:\n- If at least one of us plays scissors, we both get 0 points (same as before).\n- If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, the person playing rock wins 4 points, and the person playing paper wins 3 points.\n- If we both play rock, we both win 2 points.\n- If we both play paper, we both win 2 points.\n\nNow, with this configuration, payoffs are more balanced and there is no single strategy that consistently results in higher or equal points regardless of the opponent's actions, thus removing weak dominance. \n\nLet's construct a payoff matrix to represent this game:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (4,3), (0,0) ],\n [ (3,4), (2,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,0), (0,0) ]]\n",
