    "inferences": "To modify this game to illustrate the concept of weak dominance, we need to create a situation where one strategy weakly dominates another. This means that there is a strategy that is never worse and is sometimes better than another strategy.\n\nLet's adjust the points so that there's a weakly dominant strategy:\n\n1. Let's change the payoff so that if both play scissors, Player 1 gets 1 point and Player 2 gets 0 points.\n2. If both play rock, Player 1 gets 2 points instead of 1.\n3. The rest of the payoff points remain the same.\n\nLet's create a payoff matrix for the new version of the game:\n\n1. Scissors vs. Scissors: (1, 0) instead of (0,0)\n2. Rock vs. Rock: (2, 1) instead of (1,1)\n3. Rock vs. Paper: (3, 2)\n4. Paper vs. Rock: (2, 3) - swapping players doesn't change payoffs but context may change\n5. Paper vs. Paper: (1, 1)\n6. Scissors vs. Rock or Scissors vs. Paper remain giving both 0.\n\nNow, integrate these payoffs into a 2x2 format focusing on two of the strategies (say, Rock and Paper) to illustrate weak dominance, assuming Rock and Paper are the main strategies in this new matrix setup:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (3,2) ],\n [ (1,1), (2,3) ]]\n",
