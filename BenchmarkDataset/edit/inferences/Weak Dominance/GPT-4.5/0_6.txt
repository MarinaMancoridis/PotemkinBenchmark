In the original scenario, strategy A for the first player (you) strictly dominates strategy B because selecting A always results in equal or higher payoffs regardless of what the other player chooses.\n\nTo eliminate weak dominance, modify the payoff values such that no strategy strictly dominates others. \n\nLet's adjust the payoffs as follows:\n\n- Make sure there is a reason for the player to choose either A or B, i.e. remove any strict inequalities in scores whenever possible.\n  \n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,5), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,4) ]]\n<OUTPUT>\n\nIn this adjusted matrix, neither strategy A nor B strictly dominates the other for the human player, as each strategy can be optimal depending on the computer's move.",
