    "inferences": "To create a scenario where weak dominance is at play, we need to adjust the payoffs such that one strategy is at least as good as another in all cases, and better in at least one case for both players.\n\nConsider a modification where:\n\n1. If both firms advertise, the payoffs are (0, 0) because the advertising cost cancels out the earnings entirely.\n2. If my firm advertises and the competitor does not, my firm gets (15, 0) since the $50 million sales minus $35 million cost leaves $15 million profit, while the competitor gets 0.\n3. If my competitor advertises and my firm does not, the payoffs are (0, 15) following the same rationale as above.\n4. If neither firm advertises, both firms receive (10, 10).\n\nIn this scenario, advertising is weakly dominated by not advertising for both firms because choosing not to advertise yields a better or equal payoff no matter what the other firm does. Let's display this in a payoff matrix for clarity.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (0,15) ],\n [ (15,0), (10,10) ]]\n",
