    "inferences": "To change this example into an instance of the Weak Dominance concept from game theory, we need to introduce payoffs and strategies that show one strategy weakly dominates another for one or both players.\n\nFirst, let's understand weak dominance: A strategy weakly dominates another if it is at least as good in all scenarios and strictly better in at least one scenario.\n\nThe current scenario involves two players: you and your brother, with strategies being to go to either building 45 or building 52. The goal is for you to meet each other.\n\nLet's introduce payoffs:\n- When both you and your brother go to the same building, you receive a higher payoff because you meet each other.\n- If you go to different buildings, you receive a lower payoff because you don't meet.\n\nThe matrix below represents weak dominance by allowing a strategy to be at least as good for one player in all situations while providing a strictly better outcome in at least one situation.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
