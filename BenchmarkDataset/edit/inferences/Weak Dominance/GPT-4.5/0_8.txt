    "inferences": "To alter the example so it is not an instance of weak dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs such that neither strategy strictly outperforms the other in all scenarios. In the provided situation, advertising weakly dominates not advertising because in every case, advertising results in a higher or equal payoff for the firm than not advertising.\n\nTo ensure that neither strategy weakly dominates the other, we can modify the payoffs such that there exists at least one scenario (cell in the payoff matrix) where not advertising provides a strictly higher payoff than advertising. For this game, let's adjust the scenario where both firms do not advertise:\n\n- Original Payoffs:\n  - Both advertise: Firm A earns $0, Firm B earns $0 (after accounting for the cost of advertising).\n  - Firm A advertises, Firm B does not: Firm A earns $20, Firm B earns $0.\n  - Firm A does not advertise, Firm B advertises: Firm A earns $0, Firm B earns $20.\n  - Both do not advertise: Both Firm A and Firm B earn $10.\n\nLet's change the payoff for not advertising for both firms such that there is an additional benefit when neither advertises. By altering the last scenario to give both firms, say, $40 million instead of $10 million, neither strategy strictly dominates the other because the incentive to avoid high advertising costs might outweigh the sales revenue when both firms choose to advertise.\n\nRevised Payoffs:\n- Both advertise: Firm A earns $0, Firm B earns $0.\n- Firm A advertises, Firm B does not: Firm A earns $20, Firm B earns $0.\n- Firm A does not advertise, Firm B advertises: Firm A earns $0, Firm B earns $20.\n- Both do not advertise: Both Firm A and Firm B earn $40.\n\nThis updated scenario eliminates weak dominance since neither strategy consistently outperforms the other in all scenarios. \n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (20,0) ],\n [ (0,20), (40,40) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
