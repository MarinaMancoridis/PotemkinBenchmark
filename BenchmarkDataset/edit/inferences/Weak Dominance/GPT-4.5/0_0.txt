    "inferences": "To ensure that the situation no longer involves weak dominance in game theory, we need to adjust the scenario so that there is no clear strategy that is always better than another. In the original example, the cafe in Harvard Square strictly dominates the Central Square option because the wait time is always 5 minutes, whereas the wait time in Central Square could be longer (between 5 and 10 minutes).\n\nTo change this, we can modify the wait times such that neither location strictly dominates the other. Here's an alternative situation:\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to have dinner at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square or in Central Square. The menu is the same, and I'm considering both the wait times and a potential discount. In Harvard Square, there's always a 5-minute wait, but no discounts are offered. In Central Square, the wait time varies between 5 and 8 minutes. However, if you end up waiting for longer than 6 minutes, you receive a $5 discount on your meal.\n\nThis adjustment creates a situation where neither location strictly dominates the other, because the potential for a discount at Central Square could make it more appealing, allowing for strategic considerations rather than having a weakly dominant strategy.\n\nNow, let's generate a payoff matrix capturing this situation where no weak dominance exists: \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,0), (5,5) ],\n [ (3,5), (4,0) ]]\n",
