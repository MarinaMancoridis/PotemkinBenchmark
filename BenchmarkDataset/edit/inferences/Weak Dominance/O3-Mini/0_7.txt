    "inferences": "To modify the example to illustrate weak dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy gives a payoff at least as high for every action of the opponent, with at least one action providing a strictly higher payoff.\n\nHere's the original payoff matrix for reference:\n\n[[ (4,7), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,1) ]]\n\nLet's modify it so that action \"B\" weakly dominates action \"A\" for the first player:\n\n1. (A, A): Change the payoff for player 1 from 4 to match the payoff for player 1 when they play \"B\" and the computer plays \"A\" (currently 2). This ensures player 1 has no incentive to play \"A\" instead of \"B\" when the computer plays \"A\".\n\n2. (A, B): Keep the player 1 payoff as 0, giving a strictly lower payoff than when playing \"B\" and the computer plays \"B\" (1).\n\nNow, let's construct the new matrix that fits the condition of weak dominance, where playing \"B\" is at least as good as playing \"A\" against all possible actions by the computer, and strictly better for at least one action of the computer. Note: Changes are made to the payoffs for player 1 only, for illustration purposes, based on the rules of weak dominance:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (2,7), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,1) ]]",
