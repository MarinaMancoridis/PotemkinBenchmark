    "inferences": "To modify the scenario such that it is not an instance of Weak Dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so there is no strategy that consistently yields a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nInitially, the situation represents a simple coordination game where the preference order affects only one player. \n\nLet's modify the situation such that:\n\n1. Both you and your brother have some preference for meeting in a specific building rather than being alone, but not to the same degree.\n2. This ensures there is no clear dominant strategy for either player.\n\nHere's the revised scenario:\n\nYou\u2019re trying to meet up with your brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died. You both have nostalgia associated with certain buildings on campus, so you always meet at either building 45 or building 52 at MIT. However, this time, you both have varying preferences. You prefer being in building 52, whether alone or with him, but he strongly prefers meeting you in building 45 much more than being alone in either building. You also have a slight preference for meeting in building 45 over not meeting at all. \n\nLet's translate this into a payoff matrix:\n\n- If you both go to building 45, you both meet each other, which is slightly preferable for him. \n- If you both go to building 52, you both meet, and you greatly prefer this.\n- If you choose different buildings, you both get a lower payoff, but his preference for being alone doesn't outweigh his strong preference for meeting you.\n\nNow let\u2019s ensure this does not clearly dominate due to preferences being very situation-specific.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,2), (3,1) ],\n [ (1,3), (2,1) ]]\n",
