    "inferences": "To alter the scenario to represent an instance of Weak Dominance in game theory, we need to design payoff structures where one strategy is weakly better than another. This means that one option results in at least as high a payoff as another option in all scenarios, and in some scenario, it results in a strictly higher payoff.\n\nLet's say we assign payoffs based on the outcome of meeting (success) or not finding (failure) your brother at a chosen location. Meeting your brother gives both you and your brother a payoff, while failing to meet gives no payoff.\n\nDefine:\n- Strategies for you: Go to Building 45 or Go to Building 52\n- Strategies for your brother are unknown to you, but he will independently go to either Building 45 or Building 52.\n  \nLet\u2019s express the payoffs in terms of meeting up. Without loss of generality, assume:\n- Meeting in Building 45 gives you a payoff of 2 and him a payoff of 2.\n- Meeting in Building 52 gives you a payoff of 1 and him a payoff of 1.\n\nFor it to be an instance of Weak Dominance:\n- Let's make Building 45 weakly dominate Building 52 for you. It should yield at least the same payoff as Building 52 in all scenarios, and strictly more payoff in one or more.\n\nHere is how the payoff matrix could look:\n\nFor Player 1 (You):  \n- Building 45 (A1, A3) gives you 2 if he goes to Building 45 (A1) and 1 if he goes to Building 52 (A3).\n- Building 52 (A2, A4) always gives you 1 whether he goes to Building 45 (A2) or Building 52 (A4).\n\nFor Player 2 (Your brother):\n- Building 45 gives him 2 if you go there when he also goes there, otherwise gives a payoff equivalent to Building 52.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,0) ],\n [ (1,1), (1,1) ]]\n",
