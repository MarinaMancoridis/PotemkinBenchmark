    "inferences": "To modify this example to illustrate the concept of Weak Dominance in game theory, we need to introduce another player and strategies such that one strategy is weakly dominated by another for each player.\n\nLet's set up a scenario with two players choosing between the two cafes. Each player wants to minimize their waiting time.\n\nThe strategies for each player are:\n- Go to the Harvard Square cafe (H)\n- Go to the Central Square cafe (C)\n\nThe payoffs will be in terms of waiting times, which the players aim to minimize.\n\nGiven:\n- Harvard Square always has a 5-minute wait.\n- Central Square varies with others' choice.\n\nFor simplicity, assume:\n- If both go to Central Square, they wait 10 minutes each.\n- If one goes to Central and one to Harvard, the one at Central experiences the minimal wait time of 3 minutes, while the one at Harvard experiences the standard 5 minutes.\n\nPlayer 2's choices will impact Player 1's waiting time and vice versa. Arrange these waiting times in a payoff matrix, where lower numbers (shorter waits) are preferable.\n\nConsider the following payoffs:\n- If both players choose Harvard (H, H): Both get (5, 5).\n- If Player 1 chooses Harvard and Player 2 chooses Central (H, C): Payoffs are (5, 3).\n- If Player 1 chooses Central and Player 2 chooses Harvard (C, H): Payoffs are (3, 5).\n- If both players choose Central (C, C): Both get (10, 10).\n\nNow modify the scenario slightly to demonstrate Weak Dominance:\nLet's assume if one player goes to Central, and the other goes to Harvard, the waiting time at Central is now 4 minutes:\n\n- If Player 1 chooses Harvard and Player 2 chooses Central (H, C): Payoffs are now (5, 4).\n- If Player 1 chooses Central and Player 2 chooses Harvard (C, H): Payoffs are now (4, 5).\n\nThe modified payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (5,5), (5,4) ],\n [ (4,5), (10,10) ]]\n\nHere, choosing Central is weakly dominated by choosing Harvard for both players because:\n- Choosing Harvard never results in a worse payoff and sometimes results in a better payoff (in the case where the other player also chooses Harvard, resulting in the same payoff, but guaranteeing you never reach 10). \n- Central only gives the same or worse outcomes compared to Harvard, thus weakly dominated by Harvard for each player.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (5,4) ],\n [ (4,5), (10,10) ]]\n",
