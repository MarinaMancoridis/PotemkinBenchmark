    "inferences": "To adjust this example so that it does not illustrate weak dominance, we need to ensure there is no strategy that is better than another strategy for a player regardless of what the other player does. \n\nIn the original example, advertising is a weakly dominant strategy because it earns your firm more or the same revenue as not advertising, regardless of the competitor's choice, without any strictly better outcomes for choosing not to advertise.\n\nTo deviate from weak dominance, we can alter the payoff so that neither strategy will dominate another. Here's one such adjustment:\n\n1. If both firms advertise: Both earn $40 million in sales.\n2. If one firm advertises but the other does not: The company that advertises earns $50 million in sales, while the non-advertising firm earns $15 million.\n3. If neither firm advertises: Both earn $20 million in sales.\n\nWith these changes, there is no firm weakly dominating strategy since both outcomes (advertising or not) yield varying benefits based on the other firm's decision. \n\nThe revised decision matrix (payoffs in millions of dollars):\n\n```\n           Competitor\n            Adv     No Adv\nMy Firm\nAdv      (40, 40)   (50, 15)\nNo Adv   (15, 50)   (20, 20) \n```\n\nHere, there's no weakly dominant strategy because each decision requires consideration of the competitor's choice. The payoff differences ensure that there are trade-offs involved in decision-making.\n\nNow, let's construct an analogous payoff scenario in a simpler 2x2 matrix to ensure no strategy holds weak dominance for both players. <OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (3,4), (5,3) ],\n [ (4,5), (6,6) ]]",
