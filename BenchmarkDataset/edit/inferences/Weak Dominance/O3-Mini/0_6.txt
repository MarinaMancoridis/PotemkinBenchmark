We'll change the payoffs in such a way that no strategy weakly dominates another.\n\nLet's create a new payoff matrix where neither strategy for either player is weakly dominant:\n\n- Make one of the B-strategy entries provide a higher payoff than its corresponding A-strategy entry for Player 1.\n- Make sure that for at least one case the B-strategy gives the computer a better payoff as well.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4, 7), (0, 3) ],\n [ (3, 2), (1, 8) ]]\n",
