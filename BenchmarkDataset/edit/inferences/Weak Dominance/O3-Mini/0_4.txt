    "inferences": "In weak dominance, a strategy weakly dominates another if it gives a player a payoff that is at least as high in every scenario, with a strictly higher payoff in at least one scenario. \n\nTo make this game not an instance of weak dominance, we can modify the payoffs of some actions such that no strategy strictly outperforms another in at least one scenario. We want to ensure that the choice of any action by a player does not strictly outperform all other actions in some condition. Let\u2019s adjust the payoff for when both players choose rock, with a focus on maintaining balance in outcomes:\n\nOriginal payoffs when both choose rock: (4, 4)\n\nTo make rock not weakly dominant over paper in any situation, adjust rock to:\n\n- Adjusted payoff for both choosing rock: (3, 3)\n\nNow the payoff matrix can be constructed, ensuring no strategy weakly dominates another:\n\n1. Both choose rock: (3, 3)\n2. Both choose paper: (1, 1)\n3. One chooses rock, other chooses paper: rock gets (3), paper gets (2)\n4. At least one chooses scissors: both get (0, 0)\n\nLet's construct the payoff matrix under these new conditions:\n\n- Rock vs Rock: (3, 3)\n- Rock vs Paper: (3, 2)\n- Paper vs Rock: (2, 3)\n- Paper vs Paper: (1, 1)\n- Any choice vs Scissors: (0, 0)\n\nNow, by pairing them correctly:\n\nRock - Rock: (3,3)\nRock - Paper: (3,2)\nPaper - Rock: (2,3)\nPaper - Paper: (1,1)\nAny - Scissors: (0,0)\n\n---\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1) ]]\n",
