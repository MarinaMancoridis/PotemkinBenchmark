    "inferences": "To modify the original setup to illustrate weak dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy weakly dominates another for at least one player. Weak dominance means that a given strategy provides at least as good a payoff as another strategy in every scenario, and a strictly better payoff in at least one scenario.\n\nTo create an example of weak dominance, let's adjust the payoffs of this game. We'll set the game such that at least one strategy for one of the players is always at least as good as another strategy and better in some situations.\n\nLet's define the payoffs:\n\n- If both choose rock: Player 1 and Player 2 each receive 1 point.\n- If both choose paper: Player 1 receives 2 points, Player 2 receives 2 points.\n- If both choose scissors: Both receive 0 points.\n- If one chooses rock and the other paper: Paper receives 2 points, rock receives 3 points.\n- If one chooses rock and the other scissors: Rock receives 2 points, scissors receives 0 points.\n- If one chooses scissors and the other paper: Scissors receives 3 points, paper receives 1 point.\n\nWith this setup, let's see how strategies play out:\n  \n- For Player 1:  \n  - Choosing Paper vs Rock: (2 vs 3)\n  - Choosing Paper vs Paper: (2 vs 2)\n  - Choosing Paper vs Scissors: (1 vs 3)\n\nPaper weakly dominates Scissors for Player 1, as choosing Paper gives equal or better outcomes compared to Scissors. \n\nLet's construct the payoff matrix reflecting these observations.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (2,2) ]]\n",
