    "inferences": "To alter the scenario so that it no longer involves weak dominance, we need to adjust the expected payoffs such that there is no dominant strategy for choosing one cafe over the other based on the current information. \n\nIn the original scenario, choosing Harvard Square is weakly dominant because it always guarantees a 5-minute wait, which is never worse and sometimes better than choosing Central Square, where the wait is either equal or worse.\n\nHere's how we can change it:\n\nImagine that the two cafes now offer potentially different levels of enjoyment aside from just the wait times. Introduce a factor where the food at Central Square could sometimes be better due to a special dish that's only occasionally available. This dish is randomly available and when it is, it compensates for the longer wait time. The quality of food at Harvard Square is consistently good but never as exceptional as the special dish at Central Square.\n\nNow, the choice is not only based on wait times. If the special dish at Central Square is available, the overall experience might outweigh the consistent predictability of Harvard Square. Therefore, opting for Central Square becomes potentially better at times, creating no clearly dominant strategy without further information.\n\nWith these changes, the decision-making process involves weighing the potential benefit of a better meal against the uncertainty of longer waits, thus removing weak dominance from the equation. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (1,3) ],\n [ (2,1), (2,2) ]]\n",
