    "inferences": "To introduce the concept of weak dominance into the scenario, we need to adjust the payoffs such that one strategy weakly dominates another strategy for at least one of the firms. This means that the weakly dominant strategy should yield at least as high a payoff as any other strategy under any circumstances, and a strictly higher payoff in at least one scenario.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs with these considerations:\n\n- If both firms advertise, we both get $30 million in sales minus $35 million in advertising costs, resulting in a net loss of $5 million each.\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm gets $50 million in sales minus $35 million advertisement costs, ending with a net gain of $15 million, whereas the firm that does not advertise earns $0.\n- If neither firm advertises, they both retain their sales but without any advertising costs, thus retaining $10 million each.\n\nNow, let's create the payoff matrix. Here, there must be a condition where one strategy weakly dominates the other for at least one of the firms:\n\n|                 | Competitor Advertises | Competitor Does Not Advertise |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **My Firm Advertises** | (-5, -5)               | (15, 0)                         |\n| **My Firm Does Not Advertise** | (0, 15)               | (10, 10)                      |\n\nLet's analyze if there's weak dominance:\n\n- For my firm:\n  - Advertising yields payoffs of -5 (when the competitor advertises) and 15 (when the competitor does not advertise).\n  - Not advertising yields payoffs of 0 (when the competitor advertises) and 10 (when the competitor does not advertise).\n\nHere, not advertising weakly dominates advertising for my firm since:\n- 0 \u2265 -5 when the competitor advertises.\n- 10 \u2265 15 (but it is not strictly better in all cases).\n\nSimilarly, we can consider the situation could be symmetrical for the competitor.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-5,-5), (15,0) ],\n [ (0,15), (10,10) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
