    "inferences": "To convert this scenario into a symmetric game, we need the payoffs for both players to be the same when their strategies are exchanged. This implies that the utility for choosing universities should be symmetric between Max and Anna, meaning each player derives the same benefit from the outcomes based solely on their coordination or miscoordination.\n\nTo make the game symmetric, let's adjust their utilities so that they receive benefits based on similarity rather than differences. For example, let\u2019s have both receive positive payoffs for attending the same university and lower payoffs for going to different ones.\n\nFor simplicity:\n- If both choose Harvard, each gets +50.\n- If both choose MIT, each gets +50.\n- If they choose different universities, they each get 0.\n\nNow, let's represent this in a payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (50, 50), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (50, 50) ]]\n",
