For example, Bob might prefer writing for a computer science audience more strongly than Sally does, or have a different advantage when both target the same audience.\n\nRevised scenario:\n\nIf Bob writes for a computer science audience and Sally writes for a computer science audience, Bob will have a payoff of +3 and Sally a payoff of +2. If they both write for an economics audience, Sally will have a payoff of +3 while Bob will get a payoff of +1. If one writes for a computer science audience and the other for an economics audience, both will still have a payoff of 0 because of the mismatched audience.\n\nIn this revised version, the preferences are no longer symmetric because Bob and Sally have different payoffs when they both write for a computer science audience compared to when they both write for an economics audience.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,3) ]]",
