    "inferences": "To transform the scenario into an instance of a symmetric game, we need to adjust the utilities such that they are identical for both players for equivalent strategies, making the game symmetric. Below is one way to achieve this:\n\n**Original Utilities:**\n\n- If both study: Alex has +1 utility for passing and Laura has +1 for studying.  \n- If only Alex studies: Alex has +1 utility for passing.  \n- If only Laura studies: Laura has +1 utility for studying.  \n- If neither studies, neither gains utility.\n\n**Symmetric Modification:**\n\nTo create the symmetric structure, we'll assume the only concern is to study (effort expenditure) and not study (save effort). Both players derive +1 from studying as it leads to a better exam outcome and 0 from not studying which evens out their motivations.\n\n- If both study: Both receive +1 utility.\n- If only one studies: The one who studies receives +1.\n- If neither studies: Both receive 0.  \n\nThus, utilities can be structured identically for both Alex and Laura, eliminating asymmetry.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,1), (0,0) ]]\n",
