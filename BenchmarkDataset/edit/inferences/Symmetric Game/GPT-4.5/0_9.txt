    "inferences": "To modify this scenario such that it is not an instance of a symmetric game, let us change the payoffs specific to an individual but not identical to the strategy or payoff table for the opposing player. \n\nIntroduce a new incentive for Laura, such as a scholarship, which adds 2 to her payoff when she studies and passes, regardless of Alex's actions. Meanwhile, Alex gains no additional incentive beyond the passing utility. \n\n### Modified Scenario:\n\n- If both study, both get a score of 95, and both pass. Alex receives a utility of 1 for passing, and Laura receives a utility of 3 (1 for passing and an additional 2 from the scholarship).\n- If neither study, both get a score of 50, and neither pass. Both receive 0 utility.\n- If one studies and the other doesn't, the one who studies gets a score of 95, passes and thus receives their respective passing utility. The one who doesn't study fails and receives 0 utility.\n\nNow, let's define the payoff matrix:\n\nStudying for Alex (row player) is denoted S\u2081 and not studying is N\u2081. For Laura (column player), studying is S\u2082 and not studying is N\u2082.\n\nConditions:\n1. If both don't study: (0,0) because neither reaches the passing threshold.\n2. If both study: (1,3) Alex gets +1 utility from passing, Laura gets +3 due to passing and her scholarship.\n3. If only Alex studies: (1,0) He passes, Laura doesn't.\n4. If only Laura studies: (0,3) She passes with scholarship, Alex doesn't.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,3), (1,3) ]]\n",
