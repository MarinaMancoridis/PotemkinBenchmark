    "inferences": "To change the example so that it is no longer a symmetric game, we need to introduce a difference in payoffs such that the strategies do not yield the same outcomes for both players. Consider the following:\n\nMax derives utility not only from attending a prestigious university but also from being in a different program than Anna. As a result, he now gets a utility of +100 from attending MIT when Anna attends Harvard, but only +50 from MIT when Anna also attends MIT. If Max attends Harvard while Anna attends MIT, he receives a utility of +30, and if both are at Harvard, Max has a utility of 0.\n\nAnna, however, derives negative utility if she ends up in the same program as Max due to their rivalry. If she attends MIT when Max is at Harvard, she receives +100, but if they are both at MIT, her utility is +30. Conversely, attending Harvard while Max attends MIT gives her +50, and if both are at Harvard, her utility is 0.\n\nIn this modified scenario, the payoffs for Max and Anna depend not only on which university they each choose but also on the other's choice, leading to asymmetric utilities. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0,0), (30,50) ],\n [ (50,30), (100,100) ]]",
