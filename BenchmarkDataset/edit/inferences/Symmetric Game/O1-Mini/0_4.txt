    "inferences": "To transform this game into a symmetric game, both players should have identical payoffs when choosing the same strategies. This means that the payoff matrix must be the same for both players when they choose the same actions and symmetric when they choose different actions. Let's design a symmetric payoff structure for Steven and Bob:\n\nIn a symmetric game, both players experience the same payoffs when they both choose the same strategy and symmetrical payoffs when choosing different strategies. Therefore, we need to adjust the payoffs so they reflect this symmetry. Here's one possible way to do it:\n\n- If both Steven and Bob choose Bakey, each receives a payoff of 5.\n- If both choose Life Alive, each receives a payoff of 1.\n- If one chooses Bakey and the other chooses Life Alive, both receive a payoff of 0.\n\nThus, both prefer to coordinate on choosing Bakey, but there's a lesser payoff for coordinating on Life Alive. The asymmetry of the bonus or penalty for side-sitting is removed to ensure symmetry in payoffs.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
