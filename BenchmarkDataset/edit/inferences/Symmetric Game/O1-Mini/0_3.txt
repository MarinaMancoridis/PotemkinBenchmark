    "inferences": "To create a symmetric game, we need to ensure that the payoffs for each strategy pairing are the same for both players. As per the existing setup, the payoffs are not symmetric. Below is the adjusted scenario:\n\nBoth John and Alexa have two options: dress up or dress down. The payoffs need to reflect the same conditions for both players. Let's redefine this situation:\n\n1. If both dress down, both will receive a payoff of +5, since they are comfortable and in sync.\n\n2. If both dress up, both will receive a payoff of +2, acknowledging the effort put into looking nice but compromising some comfort.\n\n3. If one dresses up while the other dresses down, both will receive a payoff of -10, due to the awkward mismatch in attire.\n\nThis setup makes the game symmetric, as the payoffs reflect the same conditions for both players regardless of which option they choose:\n\n- Dress Up / Dress Up: (2, 2)\n- Dress Down / Dress Down: (5, 5)\n- Dress Up / Dress Down or Dress Down / Dress Up: (-10, -10)\n\nHere's how the payoff matrix looks in a symmetric form: \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (-10,-10) ],\n [ (-10,-10), (5,5) ]]\n",
