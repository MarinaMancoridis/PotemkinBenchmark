    "inferences": "To make this example not an instance of a symmetric game, we need the payoffs for each player (Alex and Laura) to differ in some way other than by a constant that can be evenly subtracted across outcomes. One way to do this is by adjusting the utility or outcomes for one of the players, ensuring that their payoff matrix differs from a symmetric structure.\n\nLet's change the payoff for Alex such that his perceived payoff for passing is different from Laura's, perhaps because his motivation changes with different outcomes. Suppose Alex derives a different payoff from passing if he studies compared to if he doesn't study.\n\n1. **Alex's Payoffs:**\n   - If Alex studies and passes, he feels proud and gains +2 utility.\n   - If Alex doesn't study and still passes (due to Laura's efforts), he feels guilty and receives 0.5 utility instead.\n2. **Laura's Payoffs (remain unchanged for simplicity):**\n   - Laura gets +1 utility from passing, whether she studied or not.\n\nThis adjustment makes their strategies and payoffs distinct. Here is how the game looks now:\n\n- Alex & Laura both study: Both pass; Payoffs = (2, 1)\n- Alex studies, Laura doesn't: Alex passes, Laura fails; Payoffs = (2, 0)\n- Alex doesn't study, Laura studies: Alex barely passes (thanks to Laura), Laura passes; Payoffs = (0.5, 1)\n- Neither study: Both fail; Payoffs = (0, 0)\n\nThis ensures that the game is asymmetric because the payoffs are not identical or simply a swap of each other\u2019s strategies. Now, let's formulate the 2x2 payoff matrix based on these changes:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (2,0) ],\n [ (0.5,1), (0,0) ]]\n",
