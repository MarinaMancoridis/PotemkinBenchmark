For instance, if both choose to dress up or dress down, give different payoff values based on personal preferences or perceived satisfaction. \n\nFor example:\n- If both dress up, John receives +2, but Alexa receives +3, reflecting her greater satisfaction with dressing nicely despite the discomfort.\n- If both dress down, John receives +5, but Alexa receives +4, indicating her lesser enjoyment despite the comfort.\n\nFinally, adjust the individual discomfort payoffs when they dress differently:\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses down, John receives -10, but Alexa could receive -8, indicating her somewhat less discomfort about the mismatch.\n- If John dresses down and Alexa dresses up, John receives -10, while Alexa receives -12, reflecting her greater unease.\n\nThis adjustment breaks the symmetry as the payoff pairs differ between corresponding strategies for the two players.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,3), (-10,-8) ],\n [ (-10,-12), (5,4) ]]\n",
