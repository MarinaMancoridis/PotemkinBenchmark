This means that when both players write for the computer science audience, both should get the same payoff, and the same should hold true for when both write for the economics audience.\n\nRevised Scenario:\n\nBob and Sally are now both skilled in both computer science and economics but derive satisfaction differently depending on the alignment of their contributions. If both target the same audience, they get maximum alignment and balance their disciplinary skills. If one targets computer science and the other economics, they still fail to synchronize, leading to confusion.\n\n- If both write for a computer science audience, both will have a payoff of +2.\n- If both write for an economics audience, both will have a payoff of +3.\n- If one writes for computer science and the other for economics or vice versa, both will have a payoff of 0.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (3,3) ]]\n",
