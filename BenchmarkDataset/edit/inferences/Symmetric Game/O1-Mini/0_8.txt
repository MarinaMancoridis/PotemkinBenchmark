    "inferences": "To transform the given scenario into a symmetric game, we must ensure that both players (Alex and Laura) have identical payoff structures regardless of their individual motivations. We'll assign payoffs in such a way that they derive the same utility from their decisions.\n\nLet's redefine their motivations and utilities so that both players share the same utilities under corresponding actions, creating a symmetric scenario:\n\n- Both Alex and Laura now derive a utility of +1 when passing and studying, +0.5 for passing and not studying, +0.5 for not passing and studying, and 0 for not passing and not studying.\n\nBased on the actions \"Study\" and \"Not Study,\" the players' payoffs can be modeled as follows. Note that in a symmetric game, the payoffs from any profile of strategies depend only on the players' actions and not on who is playing those actions. Hence, each payoff is mirrored across the diagonal in the matrix.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (1,1), (0.5,0.5) ],\n [ (0.5,0.5), (0,0) ]]",
