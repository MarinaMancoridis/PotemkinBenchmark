    "inferences": "To change the example so it no longer represents a symmetric game, we need to ensure that the payoffs for the players are not just swaps or identical under any interchange of strategies. One way to make it asymmetric is to have different baseline utilities for Steven and Bob.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs:\n\n- Steven's baseline payoff for going to Bakey can remain +2, and for going to Life Alive, it remains -2.\n- Change Bob's baseline payoff for going to Bakey to +1, and for going to Life Alive, it to -1.\n\nThe other condition remains that if they go to the same location, both receive a bonus payoff due to Steven's date.\n\nNow we describe the modified game in terms of payoffs:\n\nSteven and Bob can either go to Bakey or Life Alive:\n\n- If both go to Bakey, Steven's payoff is 2 + 100 = 102, and Bob's payoff is 1 + 100 = 101.\n- If Steven goes to Bakey while Bob goes to Life Alive, Steven's payoff is 2, and Bob's payoff is -1.\n- If both go to Life Alive, Steven's payoff is -2 + 100 = 98, and Bob's payoff is -1 + 100 = 99.\n- If Steven goes to Life Alive while Bob goes to Bakey, Steven's payoff is -2, and Bob's payoff is 1.\n\nThis new payoff matrix makes the game asymmetric as the respective strategy payoffs differ between Steven and Bob.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (102, 101), (2, -1) ],\n [ (-2, 1), (98, 99) ]]",
