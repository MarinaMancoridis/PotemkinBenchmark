    "inferences": "To change this example so that it's not an instance of a Symmetric Game, we need to ensure that the payoffs are not identical for corresponding strategic outcomes between the two players. \n\nFor example, we can change the payoffs such that if both write for a computer science audience, Bob has a payoff of +3 and Sally has a payoff of +2. If both write for an economics audience, Bob has a payoff of +1, but Sally gets a payoff of +3. Meanwhile, if Bob writes for computer science and Sally for economics, Bob receives a payoff of +1, and Sally gets a payoff of +0. Conversely, if Bob writes for economics and Sally for computer science, Bob gets a payoff of +0, and Sally receives a payoff of +1. \n\nNow, reanalyzing, the game is no longer symmetric because the payoffs differ between the players for corresponding strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,3) ]]\n",
