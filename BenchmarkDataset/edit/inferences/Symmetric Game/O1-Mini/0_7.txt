    "inferences": "To change the example so that it is no longer an instance of a symmetric game, we must ensure that the strategies or payoffs do not mirror each other. Let's alter the scenario so that Max and Anna have different preferences, leading to different utility values for each of them at each institution.\n\nRevised Scenario:\n\nMax and Anna are both deciding whether to attend Harvard or MIT for an economics PhD. Max highly values the network of professionals at Harvard, so he derives +80 utility from going to Harvard and 0 utility from going to MIT. On the other hand, Anna values the prestige of the economics program and receives +100 utility from going to MIT and 0 utility from going to Harvard. \n\nIn this revised scenario, Max's optimal strategy differs from Anna's, which ensures that the game is no longer symmetric. The changes in their utility values reflect these different preferences. Now, let's construct a payoff matrix based on these modifications. The matrix will represent the payoffs for each combination of decisions by Max and Anna. The matrix must be structured in a way that it is not symmetric.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (80,0), (0,100) ],\n [ (80,100), (0,0) ]]\n",
