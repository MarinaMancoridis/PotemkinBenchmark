    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of a Symmetric Game, we need to introduce asymmetry by altering the payoffs so that they differ depending on choices, breaking the condition that the payoffs for each player's strategies depending on the strategies chosen by the other player are not identical.\n\nHere's the revised scenario:\n\nBob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion. Both Bob and Sally have the same two options as before: target a computer science audience or an economics audience. However, suppose Bob's payoff is influenced more heavily by the match between his section and his personal expertise while Sally's payoff is slightly more independent.\n\n- If both write for a computer science audience, Bob will have a payoff of +3 (since he benefits more heavily from alignment with his field), and Sally will have a payoff of +2.\n- If Bob writes for computer science and Sally writes for economics, Bob will have a payoff of 0 and Sally will have a payoff of +1 (perhaps due to some partial benefit from diversity).\n- If both write for an economics audience, Bob will have a payoff of +1 and Sally a payoff of +2.\n- If Bob writes for economics and Sally writes for computer science, Bob's payoff will be 0 while Sally gets a payoff of +1.\n\nWith this setup, the game's symmetry is broken since the payoffs for the mutual strategies are not identical between the players. \n\nNow, we can construct a payoff matrix for this asymmetric game scenario.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (0,1), (1,2) ]]\n",
