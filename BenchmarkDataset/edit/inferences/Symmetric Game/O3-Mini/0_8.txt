    "inferences": "To turn the described scenario into a symmetric game, we need to adjust the payoffs so that they are identical for both players when their strategies are swapped. In a symmetric game, both players have the same strategies and the payoffs depend only on the strategies, not on who is playing. Here's the revised scenario:\n\nAlex and Laura are deciding whether or not to study for the upcoming final exam. Now, both have a symmetric preference toward studying and passing the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying improves their understanding and leads to a higher joint utility. The class is still graded on a curve. The payoffs for passing and intrinsic motivation have been adjusted to make the game symmetric.\n\n- If both Alex and Laura study, they both pass and derive a utility of +2 each (1 from passing and 1 from understanding).\n- If Alex studies and Laura does not, Alex passes and derives a utility of +1, while Laura does poorly and gets 0.\n- If Laura studies and Alex does not, Laura passes and derives a utility of +1, while Alex does poorly and gets 0.\n- If neither studies, both fail and derive a utility of 0.\n\nNow, the payoff matrix, which reflects symmetry for both players, would look like this:\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,1), (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
