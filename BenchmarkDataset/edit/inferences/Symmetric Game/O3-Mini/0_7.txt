This creates differing payoff matrices for each player.\n\nLet's create a payoff matrix for this adjusted game scenario:\n\n- Max's outcomes: \n  - Going to MIT (100 utility) versus Harvard (0 utility).\n- Anna's outcomes:\n  - Going to MIT (100 utility) versus Harvard (50 utility).\n\nThis leads to the payoff matrix as follows:\n\nMax / Anna:\n- Harvard: Max gets 0, Anna gets 50\n- MIT: Max gets 100, Anna gets 100\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,50), (0,100) ],\n [ (100,50), (100,100) ]]\n",
