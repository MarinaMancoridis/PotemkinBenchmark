    "inferences": "To change the scenario so it is no longer a symmetric game, we will need to adjust the payoffs so that Steven and Bob's preferences are different. \n\nIn a symmetric game, players have identical preferences and payoff structures. If we make Steven and Bob value the payoffs differently, then it becomes an asymmetric game. For instance, we can make one location more valuable to one of the players, or modify the bonus in such a way that it affects them differently. \n\nHere is a modification: Suppose that Steven's enjoyment from the funny story is much stronger than Bob's ability to make fun of him. We can set Steven's payoff of being in the same place as Bob (with the added enjoyment bonus) to be +150 instead of +100, while Bob receives the same +100. \n\nThus the payoffs can be adjusted as follows:\n\n1. If both choose Bakey, Steven gets (2 + 150) = 152, Bob gets (2 + 100) = 102.\n2. If both choose Life Alive, Steven gets (-2 + 150) = 148, Bob gets (-2 + 100) = 98.\n3. If Steven chooses Bakey and Bob chooses Life Alive, Steven gets 2, Bob gets -2.\n4. If Steven chooses Life Alive and Bob chooses Bakey, Steven gets -2, Bob gets 2.\n\nWith these adjusted payoffs:\n\n- The players no longer have identical payoffs for the same actions. \n- The game becomes asymmetric due to different valuation of the bonus.\n\nThis transforms the scenario into another type of game with asymmetric incentives.\n\nLet's construct the modified payoff matrix for this scenario:\n  \n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (152,102), (2,-2) ],\n [ (-2,2), (148,98) ]]\n",
