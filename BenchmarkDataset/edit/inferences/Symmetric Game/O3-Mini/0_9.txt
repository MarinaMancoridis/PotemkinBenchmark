Let's assume Laura derives additional utility from simply choosing to study, irrespective of passing, because she enjoys the process of studying. \n\nNow, let's redefine their utilities as follows:\n- If both study, both get a raw score of 95/100. They both pass, so Alex gets +1 and Laura gets +2 (extra utility for studying).\n- If Alex studies and Laura does not, Alex gets 95 and passes, so he gets +1. Laura gets 50 and fails (because the average score would be 72.5 and the passing mark would be 67.5), so she gets 0.\n- If Laura studies and Alex does not, Laura gets 95 and passes, so she gets +2. Alex gets 50 and fails, so he gets 0.\n- If neither studies, both get a raw score of 50/100. They both fail, so both get 0.\n\nWith these assumptions, the payoffs are no longer symmetric.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,2), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,2), (0,0) ]]\n",
