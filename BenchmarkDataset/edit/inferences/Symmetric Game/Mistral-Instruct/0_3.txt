They both have two options: dress up or dress down. The payoff matrix below represents their choices and the corresponding payoffs:\n\n[[ (5, 5), (-10, -10) ],\n [ (2, -3), (0, 0) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, Player 1 represents John and Player 2 represents Alexa. The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs for each player, where a positive number indicates a positive payoff and a negative number indicates a negative payoff.\n\n- If both players choose to dress down (option 2), they both receive a payoff of +5, as they will both feel comfortable with each other and also wear comfortable clothes.\n- If both players choose to dress up (option 1), they both receive a payoff of -10, because they will both feel awkward that the other chose to dress differently.\n- If Player 1 (John) chooses to dress up (option 1) and Player 2 (Alexa) chooses to dress down (option 2), Player 1 receives a payoff of +2 and Player 2 receives a payoff of -3, since Alexa finds her nice-looking clothes really uncomfortable.\n- If Player 1 (John) chooses to dress down (option 2) and Player 2 (Alexa) chooses to dress up (option 1), Player 1 receives a payoff of 0 and Player 2 receives a payoff of 0, as neither player is affected by the other's choice.\n\nThis game is symmetric because the payoff matrix is identical when the rows and columns are swapped, meaning that the game is the same for both players regardless of who is Player 1 and who is Player 2.",
