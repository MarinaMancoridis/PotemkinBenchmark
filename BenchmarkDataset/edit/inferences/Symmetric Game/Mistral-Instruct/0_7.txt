Anna values the quality of the program and will get 0 utility from Stanford and +100 utility from Berkeley.\n\nPayoff Matrix:\n\n[[ (0, 100), (100, 0) ],\n [ (0, 100), (100, 0) ]]\n\nIn this revised example, Max and Anna have different preferences, and the payoffs are not the same for both players when they choose the same action. This makes the game non-symmetric.",
