The workshop provides a certificate of completion that can be used for future job applications. Alex has no interest in the workshop but needs the certificate to secure a job, so he gets a utility of 100 from attending and 0 from not attending. Laura is genuinely interested in the workshop and enjoys learning, so she gets a utility of 100 from attending and 50 from not attending. If both attend, the organizers will have to split the certificate, so the utility for both players is reduced to 50. If neither attends, neither gets the certificate, so both have a utility of 0.",
