The utility values provided for each action represent the payoffs for each player. Since the utilities are the same for both players for each action, this game is a symmetric game. The payoff matrix is as follows:\n\n[[(0, 100), (100, -100)],\n [(-100, 0), (100, 100)]]\n\nIn this matrix, the rows represent the actions of Player 1 (Max), and the columns represent the actions of Player 2 (Anna). The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs for each player. For example, if Max chooses Harvard and Anna chooses MIT, Max gets a payoff of 0 and Anna gets a payoff of 100. If both choose the same university, Max gets a payoff of 100 and Anna gets a payoff of -100.",
