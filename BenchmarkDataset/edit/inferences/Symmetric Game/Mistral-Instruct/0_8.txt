Since Alex is only concerned with passing, the average score will be (95 + 50) / 2 = 72.5. The passing grade is set to be 5 percentage points below the average, so the passing grade is 72.5 * 0.95 = 69.025. Since Laura didn't study, her score will be 50/100 = 0.5. Alex's utility from passing is 1, so Alex's payoff is 1 - 69.025 = -68.025. Laura's utility from not studying is 0, so Laura's payoff is 0.\n- A4, B4: Alex doesn't study, Laura studies. The average score will be (50 + 95) / 2 = 72.5. The passing grade is set to be 5 percentage points below the average, so the passing grade is 72.5 * 0.95 = 69.025. Since Alex didn't study, his score will be 50/100 = 0.5. Alex's utility from not passing is 0, so Alex's payoff is 0. Laura's utility from studying is 1, so Laura's payoff is 1.",
