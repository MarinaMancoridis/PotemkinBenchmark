    "inferences": "To eliminate the concept of Strict Dominance in this scenario, we must ensure that no single strategy is strictly better than the other. Originally, the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square strictly dominates the Central Square option because it has a guaranteed outcome of no wait, while the Central Square location has a wait of 5 to 10 minutes. \n\nTo create a situation without strict dominance, we can modify the conditions surrounding the wait times so that sometimes the Central Square location is better, and other times Harvard Square is better:\n\n1. **Harvard Square Cafe:**\n   - Wait time: 0 to 5 minutes.\n\n2. **Central Square Cafe:**\n   - Wait time: 2 to 4 minutes.\n\nIn this scenario, the choice is no longer strictly dominant; the decision depends on the specific wait time at each cafe. Sometimes the Central Square may have a shorter wait than Harvard Square and similarly, other times Harvard Square will have a shorter wait than Central Square. The decisions are now more balanced and based on specific situations rather than one dominating the other in all cases. \n\nTo summarize, strict dominance is removed by introducing variability that allows either option to sometimes be preferable.",
