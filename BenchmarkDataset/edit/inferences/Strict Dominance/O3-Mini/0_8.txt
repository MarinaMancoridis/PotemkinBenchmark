    "inferences": "In the original scenario, we have a typical situation of strict dominance where each firm's decision to advertise or not leads to predictable outcomes. If a firm advertises while the other doesn't, the advertising firm gains all sales revenue but deducts advertising costs, leading to a higher payoff. If both advertise, they split the sales and incur advertising costs, which lowers the payoff compared to not advertising.\n\nTo modify this so strict dominance isn't present, let's adjust the payoffs by changing how advertising affects sales distribution or the cost of advertising:\n\nScenario Change:\n- If both firms advertise, instead of the usual $25 million each after subtracting advertising costs, they could gain some synergy from increased market brand and both end up with $30 million, considering the market expands due to advertising efforts.\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm gets $35 million in sales (after accounting for an increased advertising effectiveness), while the non-advertising firm gets $15 million due to residual brand recognition and pieces of market expansion.\n- If neither advertises, keep the scenario where they split the market evenly with both receiving $25 million.\n\nUnder these new payoffs, advertising does not strictly dominate not advertising as there are scenarios where not advertising or both firms advertising could provide higher payoffs or equal utility.\n\nNow, construct the payoff matrix based on these changes: \n\nPlayer 1: My firm\nPlayer 2: Competitor firm\n\n- Both firms not advertising:\n  * Player 1: $25 million, Player 2: $25 million\n- My firm advertises, competitor firm does not:\n  * Player 1: $35 million, Player 2: $15 million\n- My firm does not advertise, competitor firm advertises:\n  * Player 1: $15 million, Player 2: $35 million\n- Both firms advertise:\n  * Player 1: $30 million, Player 2: $30 million\n\nThis setup means there's no strictly dominating strategy since choices depend on what the competitor does.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (25,25), (35,15) ],\n [ (15,35), (30,30) ]]",
