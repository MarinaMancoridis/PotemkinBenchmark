    "inferences": "To modify the given rock-paper-scissors game to include strict dominance, we'll adjust the payoffs so that one strategy consistently offers higher payoffs regardless of the opponent's action.\n\nIn traditional game theory terms, a strategy strictly dominates another if it results in a strictly better payoff regardless of what the other player does. Let's select payoffs such that one choice clearly dominates the others for at least one player. This means we want to introduce payoffs where one option always yields higher rewards.\n\nLet's alter the payoff matrix:\n\n- Align the payoffs such that one option strictly dominates others.\n\nHere's an illustration:\n\n1. **Player 1**: \n    - Strategy X dominates if it gives better rewards regardless of Player 2's choice.\n    \n2. **Player 2**: \n    - Strategy Y dominates if it provides higher payoffs irrespective of Player 1's move.\n\nNow, based on these changes, let's define a modified game incorporating strict dominance for Player 1:\n\nAssume:\n- Strategy A over Strategy B such that A always grants more points than B for Player 1.\n  \nWe can design a payoff matrix where Strategy A for Player 1 gives better payoffs against all options of Player 2.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,2), (5,3) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,0) ]]\n",
