    "inferences": "To modify this scenario to include strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs such that one strategy always results in a better payoff than the other, regardless of the opponent's strategy. Let's define the payoffs in a way that advertising strictly dominates not advertising for both firms.\n\nAssume Player 1 is \"My firm\" and Player 2 is \"Competitor firm\". Let's rewrite the payoffs when:\n\n1. Both firms do not advertise:\n   - Both firms get $25 million each.\n   \n2. One firm advertises and the other does not:\n   - The firm that advertises incurs a cost of $25 million but gets $50 million in sales, thus netting $25 million.\n   - The firm that does not advertise gets $0.\n\n3. Both firms advertise:\n   - Both incur a cost of $25 million and split $50 million, netting $0.\n\nTo achieve strict dominance, we'll adjust the payoffs when neither advertises such that advertising becomes strictly better. Let's set those payoffs to make not advertising strictly worse.\n\nNew Payoff Conditions:\n- If neither advertise, both firms make $10 million each instead of $25 million.\n\nGiven these conditions, advertising strictly dominates not advertising because advertising guarantees at least the same or better net payoff in all cases compared to not advertising. Here is the updated payoff matrix for the scenario:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10, 10), (0, 50) ],\n [ (50, 0), (0, 0) ]]\n",
