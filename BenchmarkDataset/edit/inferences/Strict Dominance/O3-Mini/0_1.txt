    "inferences": "To create a game theory scenario involving strict dominance, we'll need to define a decision-making situation where one strategy is better than another, regardless of what the other player does.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a game between two players, Player 1 and Player 2, competing on choosing a restaurant with the minimum waiting time. We will set up a payoff matrix so that one restaurant (let\u2019s say Harvard Square) is strictly better than the other (Central Square) for both players, regardless of what the other player chooses.\n\nHere's how we can set it up:\n\n1. **Players:** Two individuals choosing between two restaurants, Harvard Square (H) and Central Square (C).\n2. **Strategies:** Each player picks one restaurant.\n3. **Payoffs:** Lower waiting times correspond to higher payoffs. We will use integers for simplicity. Since there is never a wait at Harvard Square, it will have consistently higher payoffs for both players compared to Central Square.\n\n**Game Setup:**\n\n- If Player 1 chooses Harvard and Player 2 also chooses Harvard, both get the highest benefit due to no wait time at Harvard, let\u2019s say 10.\n- If one chooses Harvard and the other Central, the one choosing Harvard gets the higher payoff (e.g., 10), and the one choosing Central gets a lower payoff due to potential wait (e.g., 5).\n- If both choose Central, they each get the lowest payoff (e.g., 5) due to potential waits.\n\nThis will result in strict dominance for the Harvard strategy.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,10), (10,5) ],\n [ (5,10), (5,5) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
