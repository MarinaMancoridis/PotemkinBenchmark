    "inferences": "To transform this scenario into an instance involving the concept of Strict Dominance, we need to structure the situation such that one strategy (or option) is always better for a player, regardless of what the other player chooses. In this context, that means assigning payoffs such that, for one player, one option always results in a better outcome, regardless of the second player's decision.\n\nConsider this revised scenario:\n\n---\n\nYou are meeting your brother who dislikes building 52 very much due to its lack of amenities, but will reluctantly agree to meet there if it's the only way to find you. Meanwhile, for you, finding your brother is the top priority, and both locations are equally convenient in terms of travel time. As such, you will derive satisfaction from ensuring a meeting, but your brother derives negative utility from meeting in building 52.\n\nIn this situation:\n\n1. If you choose building 45 and he chooses building 45, you find each other and neither is inconvenienced.\n2. If you choose building 45 and he chooses building 52, you do not find each other.\n3. If you choose building 52, regardless of his choice, you ensure meeting him albeit with his discomfort if it ends up being building 52.\n\nWe now setup a payoff matrix to reflect this scenario, ensuring that the choice of building 52 for you strictly dominates the choice of building 45 due to ensured meeting. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
