    "inferences": "To transform the given modified rock-paper-scissors scenario such that it is not an instance of strict dominance in game theory, we need to adjust the payoff structure so that no single strategy is the best response independently of the other player's actions. In the original scenario, one strategy might strictly dominate another if it results in higher payoffs regardless of what the opponent plays.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs to ensure that no strategy strictly dominates any other strategy. One way to achieve this is by adjusting the payoff values so each strategy is a best response against at least one of the opponent's choices, preventing any strategy from being strictly better than the others.\n\nHere's a modified payoff matrix:\n\n- Rock vs Rock: Both get 5 points.\n- Rock vs Paper: Rock gets 2 points, Paper gets 4 points.\n- Rock vs Scissors: Rock gets 10 points, Scissors gets 0 points.\n- Paper vs Rock: Paper gets 6 points, Rock gets 3 points.\n- Paper vs Paper: Both get 1 point.\n- Paper vs Scissors: Paper gets 0 points, Scissors gets 2 points.\n- Scissors vs Rock: Scissors gets 3 points, Rock gets 7 points.\n- Scissors vs Paper: Scissors gets 5 points, Paper gets 1 point.\n- Scissors vs Scissors: Both get 2 points.\n\nAdjust these values to ensure no strategy strictly dominates another. The goal is to balance the payoffs so that each strategy remains viable depending on the opponent's choice.\n\nOnce you've decided on the adjusted payoffs, the game can be represented by a payoff matrix that encapsulates these new values. The matrix presents the strategies for both players and demonstrates that the game\u2019s structure prevents any single strategy from strictly dominating others. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (2,4), (10,0) ],\n [ (6,3), (1,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (3,7), (5,1), (2,2) ]]\n",
