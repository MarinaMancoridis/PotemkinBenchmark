Let's modify the payoffs to achieve this condition. \n\nFor instance, to make \"A\" strictly dominant for Player 1, playing \"A\" should always result in a better payoff for Player 1 compared to playing \"B\", irrespective of what Player 2 chooses.\n\nHere's the revised payoff matrix:\n\n- Actions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\n- Actions (A, B) leads to payoffs (4, 3)\n- Actions (B, A) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\n- Actions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\nNow, observe that:\n- If the computer chooses A, my payoffs are 4 (with A) and 2 (with B); thus, A is better.\n- If the computer chooses B, my payoffs are 4 (with A) and 1 (with B); thus, A is better.\n\nThus, A strictly dominates B for me (Player 1).\n\nLet's modify the payoffs in matrix format:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4, 7), (4, 3) ],\n [ (2, 2), (1, 1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
