If the student chooses Strategy A2, they will receive a payoff of 2 if the exam goes well, but 0 if it does not.\n\nSimilarly, if the exam goes well, the teacher (Player 2) will receive a payoff of 2 if the student chooses Strategy A1, and 4 if they choose Strategy A2. If the exam does not go well, the teacher will receive a payoff of 0 if the student chooses Strategy A1, and 3 if they choose Strategy A2.\n\nNeither strategy strictly dominates the other because there is no strategy that guarantees a better outcome for both players in all scenarios.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 2), (2, 0) ],\n [ (1, 4), (0, 3) ]]",
