The first number in each pair represents the payoff for you, and the second number represents the payoff for your brother.\n\n- If you go to building 45 (A1), your payoff is 3, and your brother's payoff is 1.\n- If you go to building 52 (A2), your payoff is 1, and your brother's payoff is 0.\n- If your brother goes to building 45 (B1), your payoff is 1, and your brother's payoff is 0.\n- If your brother goes to building 52 (B2), your payoff is 0, and your brother's payoff is 2.\n\nIn this matrix, you have a dominant strategy to choose building 52 (A2) as it always gives you a higher payoff compared to building 45 (A1). However, your brother's strategy is not dominant, as he gets a higher payoff when you choose building 45 (B1) and he goes to building 52.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 1), (1, 0) ],\n [ (0, 2), (0, 0) ]]",
