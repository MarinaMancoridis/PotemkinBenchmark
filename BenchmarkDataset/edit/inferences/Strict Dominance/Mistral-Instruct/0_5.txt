Here's the payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (3, 2), (4, 1) ],\n [ (0, -10), (1, 0) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, Player 1's strategies are represented along the horizontal axis, and Player 2's strategies are represented along the vertical axis. The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs for each player when they play the corresponding strategies.\n\nPlayer 1 can choose between playing Rock (R) or Paper (P), while Player 2 can choose between playing Rock (R) or Scissors (S).\n\nIn this game, playing Rock strictly dominates playing Paper for Player 1, as Player 1 gets a higher payoff in both cases when playing Rock compared to when playing Paper. This is an example of strict dominance in game theory.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 2), (4, 1) ],\n [ (0, -10), (1, 0) ]]",
