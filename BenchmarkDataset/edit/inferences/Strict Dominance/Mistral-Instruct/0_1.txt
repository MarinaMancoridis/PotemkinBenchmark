Player 1 is deciding between two Life Alive cafes, and Player 2 represents the wait time at the Central Square cafe.\n\n[[ (0, 0), (0, 10) ],\n [ (0, 0), (0, 0) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, Player 1 (You) has two strategies: choosing the Harvard Square cafe (A1) or the Central Square cafe (A2). Player 2 (the wait time at the Central Square cafe) has two possible outcomes: no wait (B1) or a wait between 0 and 10 minutes (B2).\n\nIf you choose the Harvard Square cafe (A1), the wait time is always 0 (B1), which is better than any wait time at the Central Square cafe (B2). Therefore, choosing the Harvard Square cafe is a strict dominant strategy.\n\nIf you choose the Central Square cafe (A2), the wait time can vary between 0 and 10 minutes (B2), which is worse than the 0 wait time at the Harvard Square cafe (B1). Therefore, choosing the Harvard Square cafe is strictly dominant.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 0), (0, 10) ],\n [ (0, 0), (0, 0) ]]",
