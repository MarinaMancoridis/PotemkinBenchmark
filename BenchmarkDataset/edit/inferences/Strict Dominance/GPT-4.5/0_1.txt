    "inferences": "To create a scenario involving strict dominance, we need to establish payoffs for two options where one option always yields a better outcome than the other, regardless of what others choose. In this situation, the payoff could be inversely related to the wait time\u2014shorter wait times lead to higher payoffs.\n\nLet's assume:\n\n- The payoff at Harvard Square is constant since there's never a wait (high payoff).\n- The payoff at Central Square depends on the wait time, ranging from 0 to 10 minutes (lower payoff as wait time increases).\n\nTo explicitly create a strictly dominant strategy, the payoffs need to ensure that one option is always better than the other. \n\nAssume Player 1 (you) is deciding between Harvard Square (H) and Central Square (C). Define payoffs based on wait times as:\n\n- Harvard Square (H) always has a payoff of 10 because there is never a wait.\n- Central Square (C) has a payoff ranging from 0 to 9.\n\nTherefore, H strictly dominates C because the payoff at H (10) is always greater than any possible payoff at C (0 to 9).\n\nNow let's generate a 2x2 payoff matrix that illustrates a scenario of strict dominance for another context, as requested. <OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (10, 5), (10, 4) ],\n [ (3, 6), (2, 7) ]]",
