    "inferences": "To transform the example into an instance of strict dominance, you should adjust the scenario so that for your brother, one building is strictly better than the other. Since you aim to find him, you would choose based on his preference.\n\nThe revised scenario could be: My brother prefers building 45 over building 52 under all circumstances. Therefore, building 45 is strictly dominant for him, and he will always choose it unless influenced otherwise. Hence, knowing his preference, I should also go to building 45 to find him, because he will strictly favor this location.\n\nNow, let's create a payoff matrix with these preferences:\n\n- For your brother (Player 1), building 45 is strictly better than building 52, no matter what you do. Let's assign higher payoffs for him in building 45 than in building 52.\n- For you (Player 2), building location doesn't affect your payoff since your goal is solely to meet your brother.\n\nWe'll represent the payoff matrix as follows, indicating strict dominance for building 45 for Player 1. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (0,1) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
