In the original scenario, the brother strictly prefers building 45 over building 52, which means he will never choose building 52 unless forced, creating a strictly dominant strategy for him to always choose building 45.\n\nLet's change the brother's preferences so there is no strict dominance:\n\n---\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know that he'll go to one of those buildings right now. I know that he prefers building 45 slightly over building 52 but doesn't hate 52 and often chooses based on the weather. As for me, for any fixed building that I go to, I\u2019d prefer to see my brother there than to not see him there. But honestly, I like building 52 more and would rather be alone in building 52 than with my brother in building 45. Which building should I go to?\n\n---\n\nIn this modified example, the brother does not have a strictly dominant strategy, as he has some preference but might choose either building, depending on the situation. Similarly, for me, there\u2019s no strict dominance since the choice depends on multiple factors, other than just the presence or absence of my brother. This adjustment eliminates the notion of strict dominance from the scenario.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (1,0) ],\n [ (2,2), (0,1) ]]\n",
