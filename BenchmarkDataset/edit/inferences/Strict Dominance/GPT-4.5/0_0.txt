    "inferences": "To make this not an instance of strict dominance, I need to adjust the payoffs or conditions such that both options have circumstances where each could be the more appealing choice.\n\nFor example, if the Central Square cafe offers a special discount, faster service, or additional perks that vary based on the size of the crowd, then there might be situations where someone would prefer to choose the Central Square location, despite its potentially longer waiting time.\n\nConsider the following adjustment to the scenario:\n\nAlong with the waiting time, let's say the Central Square cafe offers a \"Happy Hour\" discount on their most popular dish for orders placed between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM. The Harvard Square location does not offer this discount. As a result, depending on the customer's interest in the discount and the potential shorter wait times at Harvard Square, a diner might choose one location over the other, leading to scenarios where neither location strictly dominates the other.\n\nAdding this new element means that the decision now depends not only on the expected wait time but also on other factors like cost savings, effectively removing strict dominance from the scenario.\n\nNow, let's apply a similar approach to construct a 2x2 payoff matrix that doesn't demonstrate strict dominance for either player. In this case, the payoffs should reflect situations where each strategy could be favorable depending on the opponent's move. A proper matrix meeting these criteria will ensure no row strictly dominates another and no column strictly dominates another for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (1,4) ],\n [ (2,3), (4,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
