    "inferences": "To make the given game not an instance of strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no single strategy strictly dominates another for any player. Strict dominance occurs when one strategy is better than another strategy in every possible scenario for one player.\n\nLet\u2019s review the original game:\n1. Scissors vs. Rock: Rock wins 10 points, Scissors wins 0 points.\n2. Scissors vs. Paper: Paper wins 1 point, Scissors wins 0 points.\n3. Scissors vs. Scissors: Both win 0 points.\n4. Rock vs. Paper: Rock wins 3 points, Paper wins 2 points.\n5. Rock vs. Rock: Both win 4 points.\n6. Paper vs. Paper: Both win 1 point.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs so that no strategy strictly dominates another for any player. Here, we'll ensure that there isn't any strategy that consistently outperforms others across all of the opponent\u2019s strategies.\n\nTo remove strict dominance, we need to introduce some variability where each choice has scenarios where it can be preferable:\n\n- Adjust \"Scissors vs. Rock\" so that Scissors can have a positive payoff in some scenario.\n- Adjust \"Scissors vs. Paper\" to offer Scissors an advantage at least one time.\n- Provide an instance where Paper vs. Rock yields a higher payoff for Paper.\n\nHere's a new setup:\n\n1. **Scissors vs. Rock**: Rock wins 8 points, Scissors wins 2 points (Scissors now earns in some cases).\n2. **Scissors vs. Paper**: Paper wins 2 points, Scissors wins 1 point (Closer contest).\n3. **Scissors vs. Scissors**: Both win 2 points.\n4. **Rock vs. Paper**: Rock wins 4 points, Paper wins 3 points (Bringing scores closer).\n5. **Rock vs. Rock**: Both win 4 points.\n6. **Paper vs. Paper**: Both win 2 points (Adjusted to avoid strict dominance).\n\nNow, the payoff matrix based on this new setup will be:\n\n- Strategies (Row: Player 1, Column: Player 2)\n- R = Rock\n- P = Paper\n- S = Scissors\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,4), (3,4), (8,2) ],\n [ (4,3), (2,2), (1,2) ],\n [ (2,8), (1,2), (2,2) ]]\n",
