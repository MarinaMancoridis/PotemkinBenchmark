    "inferences": "To change the provided example so that it is not an instance of strict dominance, we need to tweak the payoff structure so that there is no clear strategy that always gives a better payoff than another strategy, regardless of what the opponent does.\n\nIn the original example, the firm has a strictly dominant strategy: to advertise, because it ensures higher or equal payoffs compared to not advertising, irrespective of what the other firm decides. Let's alter the payoffs such that neither strategy strictly dominates the other for either firm.\n\nLet's assume the following new setup:\n\n- If both firms advertise, they split the market, so each gets $25 million, and both incur a $10 million advertising cost, leading to a payoff of $15 million for each firm.\n  \n- If neither firm advertises, they still split the market without incurring any advertising costs, leading to a payoff of $25 million for each firm.\n  \n- If one firm advertises while the other does not, the firm that advertises gets the whole market and incurs a $10 million advertising cost, resulting in a $40 million payoff, while the other firm receives nothing.\n\nIn this new scenario, the payoffs can be represented in a matrix as follows:\n\n- Row strategies represent Company A's options (Advertise or Not Advertise).\n- Column strategies represent Company B's options (Advertise or Not Advertise).\n\nLet's fill in the payoff matrix based on the description:\n\n1. If both firms advertise, each incurs a $10 million cost, so the payoffs are (15,15).\n2. If neither firm advertises, no one incurs costs and they split the market, so it's (25,25).\n3. If Company A advertises and Company B does not, the payoffs are (40,0).\n4. If Company B advertises and Company A does not, the payoffs are (0,40).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (15,15), (40,0) ],\n [ (0,40), (25,25) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
