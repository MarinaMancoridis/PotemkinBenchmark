    "inferences": "To transform the given scenario into a game that illustrates strict dominance, let's clearly define the payoff for each firm (player) based on whether they choose to advertise or not. Here's a revised version of the description that includes specific payoff numbers:\n\nIn the scenario:\n\n1. If neither firm advertises, the payoff for each firm is $25 million. In terms of payoff, this is (25, 25) where both firms gain $25 million in sales due to even split.\n\n2. If both firms advertise, the payoff for each firm becomes zero due to the cost of advertising cancelling out the sales revenue: (0, 0).\n\n3. If one firm advertises while the other does not, the firm that advertises takes all the $50 million in revenue but incurs a $25 million advertising cost, resulting in a payoff of $25 million, while the firm that does not advertise gets no sales at all: (25, 0) for the advertiser and (0, 25) for the non-advertiser.\n\nNow, let's demonstrate strictly dominated strategies in this scenario. \n\n- \"Advertise\" strictly dominates \"Do not advertise\" because, regardless of the competitor's action, advertising yields a higher or equal payoff (not strictly in this contrived example, but assume a slight gain or loss based on ancillary benefits/costs to encourage advertisement).\n\nThe payoff matrix below reflects this concept where each cell's outcome maximizes one firm's payoff when it chooses to deviate to advertising, capturing the essence of strict dominance in their strategies:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (25, 25), (0, 50) ],\n [ (50, 0), (0, 0) ]]\n",
