    "inferences": "To ensure the game is not an instance of strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no strategy strictly dominates another for either player. Currently, action A for Player 1 does not strictly dominate B because the payoff is not higher against every action of Player 2. Similarly, we want a situation in which neither player's action strictly dominates the other player's action. \n\nWe will adjust the payoffs to remove strict dominance:\n\n- For Player 1, action A currently has payoffs 4 (against A) and 0 (against B). Action B has payoffs 2 (against A) and -1 (against B). We will change these so there is no strictly superior strategy.\n\n- For Player 2, action A has payoffs 7 (against A) and 2 (against B). Action B has payoffs 3 (against A) and 1 (against B). We will also change these so there is no strictly superior strategy.\n\nHere's a payoff matrix with these considerations: \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,4), (2,3) ],\n [ (3,2), (2,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
