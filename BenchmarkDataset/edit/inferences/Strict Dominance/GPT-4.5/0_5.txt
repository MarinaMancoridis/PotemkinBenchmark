    "inferences": "To incorporate the concept of Strict Dominance into this game, it's crucial to adjust the payoffs such that one strategy strictly dominates another for one of the players. For a strategy to strictly dominate another, it must yield a better payoff in all circumstances compared to the dominated strategy.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs:\n1. As before, if one person plays scissors and the other plays rock, rock wins, but now let's have rock win 2 points and scissors win 0 points to ensure the dominance.\n2. If one person plays scissors and the other plays paper, paper wins 2 points and scissors wins 1 point to favor paper over scissors strictly.\n3. If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, let's now have rock win 1 point, and paper wins 4 points to ensure no dominance.\n4. If both play the same move, they both win the same points as in the original but adjust to fit in a dominance structure.\n\nGiven these constraints, the objective is to create a matrix so that at least one strategy dominates another one strictly for one of the players. Under the new setup, let's say for Player 1, playing paper strictly dominates playing scissors. \n\nThus, let's propose a payoff matrix that reflects these adjustments.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,4), (1,4) ],\n [ (0,2), (2,0) ]]\n",
