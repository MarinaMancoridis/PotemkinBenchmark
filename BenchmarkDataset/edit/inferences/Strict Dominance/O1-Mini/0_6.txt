I'll modify the payoffs so that neither player has a strictly dominant strategy.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs in a way that makes both players' decisions not dominated by any single strategy. For example:\n\n1. For Player 1, neither action should always yield a higher payoff than the other.\n2. Similarly, for Player 2, neither action should always yield a higher payoff than the other.\n\nHere's a modified version of the payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (4, 3), (1, 5) ],\n [ (3, 2), (2, 4) ]]\n\nIn this matrix:\n- Player 1: No dominant strategy exists, as playing A sometimes yields higher payoffs (4 > 3) but not always (1 < 2).\n- Player 2: Likewise, no dominant strategy exists for Player 2, as playing A can yield higher payoffs (5 > 4) but not in every instance (3 < 2).\n\nTherefore, the condition of strict dominance is removed. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4, 3), (1, 5) ],\n [ (3, 2), (2, 4) ]]\n",
