    "inferences": "To modify the given scenario to illustrate an instance of strict dominance, we need to create a situation where one strategy strictly dominates another, meaning it always results in a better payoff regardless of the opponent's actions.\n\nLet's change the payoffs as follows:\n\n- If one person plays scissors and the other plays rock, then rock wins 5 points and scissors wins 0 points. Scissors is worse off in this matchup.\n- If one person plays scissors and the other plays paper, then scissors wins 2 points, and paper wins 0 points. Here, scissors is better.\n- If both players play scissors, then both win 1 point.\n  \nLet's keep:\n- If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, the person playing rock wins 3 points, and the person playing paper wins 2 points.\n- If both play rock, both win 4 points.\n- If both play paper, both win 1 point.\n\nNow, let's construct a payoff matrix from this scenario showcasing strict dominance. We'll remove dominance from one option for one player.\n\nPlayer 1 strategies (rows) and Player 2 strategies (columns) are: Rock (R), Paper (P), Scissors (S).\n\n|       | R       | P       | S       |\n|-------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **R** | (4,4)   | (3,2)   | (5,0)   |\n| **P** | (2,3)   | (1,1)   | (0,2)   |\n| **S** | (0,5)   | (2,0)   | (1,1)   |\n\nFrom this matrix, for Player 2:\n\n- Playing R strictly dominates playing S, as it results in higher payoffs against all of Player 1's strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (4,4), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1) ]]",
