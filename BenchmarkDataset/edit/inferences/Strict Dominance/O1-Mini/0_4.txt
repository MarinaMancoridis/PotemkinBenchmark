    "inferences": "To make the game not an instance of strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no single strategy strictly dominates another for any player. In strict dominance, one strategy is better than another strategy for one player, irrespective of what the other player chooses.\n\nIn the original example, observe the payoffs:\n\n- Scissors vs. Rock: Rock = 10, Scissors = 0\n- Scissors vs. Paper: Paper = 1, Scissors = 0\n- Scissors vs. Scissors: Scissors = 0, Scissors = 0\n- Rock vs. Paper: Rock = 3, Paper = 2\n- Rock vs. Rock: Rock = 4, Rock = 4\n- Paper vs. Paper: Paper = 1, Paper = 1\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs such that no strategy strictly dominates another:\n\n1. Ensure that for Scissors against Paper and Rock, the outcomes mixed in a way that choosing Scissors is not always the worst.\n2. Adjust scenarios such as Rock vs. Paper so that neither is strictly better than Scissors or Paper under all conditions.\n\nHere's a revised payoff structure avoiding strict dominance:\n\n- Scissors vs. Rock: Rock gets 10, Scissors 0\n- Scissors vs. Paper: Paper gets 1, Scissors 2\n- Scissors vs. Scissors: Scissors gets 2, Scissors 2\n- Paper vs. Rock: Rock gets 3, Paper 6\n- Rock vs. Rock: Rock gets 4, Rock 4\n- Paper vs. Paper: Paper gets 1, Paper 1\n\nThese changes made:\n- Scissors can now win against Paper.\n- Rock isn't always better than Paper.\n- No single option is strictly better in every circumstance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,6) ],\n [ (0,10), (3,2) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
