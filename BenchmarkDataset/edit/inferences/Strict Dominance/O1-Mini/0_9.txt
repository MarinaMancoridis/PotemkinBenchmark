    "inferences": "To transform this into a game theory example of strict dominance, we need to create a payoff matrix where one strategy strictly dominates the other for each player. This means that one strategy will yield a better payoff than the other strategy, regardless of the opponent's actions.\n\nWe'll create a payoff matrix for the advertising scenario:\n\n- If neither firm advertises, both firms receive $25 million since the advertising costs are zero.\n- If both firms advertise, they both receive $25 million in sales but incur a $25 million advertising cost, leading to $0 net.\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm will get $50 million, and the non-advertising firm will get $0, considering sales only (sales minus costs for advertising firm is $25 million, no cost for non-advertising).\n\nIn this scenario, advertising strictly dominates not advertising for both players because regardless of what the competitor does, advertising always yields a payoff that's either equal to or better than the alternative.\n\nLet's organize this into the payoff matrix:\n\nLet Player 1 be \"My Firm\" and Player 2 be \"Competitor Firm\".\n\n- Play \"A\" means Advertise.\n- Play \"N\" means Not Advertise.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n    & \\text{Player 2: A} & \\text{Player 2: N} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\text{Player 1: A} & (0, 0) & (25, 0) \\\\\n    \\text{Player 1: N} & (0, 25) & (25, 25) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNow, in numerical matrix form as described in the instructions:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (25,0) ],\n [ (0,25), (25,25) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
