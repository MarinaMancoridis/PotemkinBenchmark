    "inferences": "To make this situation an instance of strict dominance, we need to form a scenario where one strategy strictly dominates the other for one player. In the original scenario, your brother has a strict preference of not going to building 52 unless compelled, whereas you have no preference between the buildings as long as you meet your brother. Here's how the scenario can be rewritten for strict dominance:\n\nImagine you both have the option to choose between building 45 or building 52 simultaneously without knowing the other\u2019s choice, and you both want to meet the other more than being in a certain location. However, your brother, having a strict dislike for building 52, has a payoff value of 0 for being in building 52. In contrast, he has a payoff of 1 for being in building 45 if that's where you are. Similarly, if you choose building 45, both of you have the highest combined payoff because you are optimally synchronized.\n\nFor you, the payoff for meeting your brother is always greater than being at a different place, but since you desire to meet him more than being at a location by yourself, you would have a higher payoff when you both choose the same location.\n\nThus, if both always strive for the highest outcome, both should choose building 45 despite it being hypothetically equal for you initially, because for your brother, choosing building 45 is strictly dominant.\n\nLet's illustrate this using a payoff matrix where choosing building 45 gives you both the highest combined payoff:\n\n- If you both choose building 45, you both meet and have a payoff of 3 each.\n- If you mistakenly choose different buildings, you yield a payoff of 0.\n- If you choose building 52 and he chooses building 45, you gain nothing since he won't be there to meet you.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,1) ]]\n",
