    "inferences": "The original scenario described a situation where advertising is strictly dominated by not advertising, as each firm's payoff is reduced by the cost of advertising no matter what the competitor does.\n\nTo change this scenario to not be an instance of strict dominance, we must adjust the payoffs such that neither strategy (advertising or not advertising) strictly dominates the other for either firm. Here's a modified version of the scenario:\n\nImagine that advertising also has an additional strategic benefit that can improve the market share or consumer loyalty in the long run, but at a smaller immediate gain. Therefore, even though advertising is costly, it can occasionally lead to higher payoffs than not advertising, based on the competitor's choice:\n\n- If neither firm advertises, both earn $25 million.\n- If both firms advertise, both earn $18 million (after considering a $10 million advertising cost).\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm earns $30 million, and the non-advertising firm earns $22 million.\n\nThis setup eliminates strict dominance because there's no single option that always results in a higher payoff regardless of the competitor's action. Instead, the decision to advertise or not depends on the actions of the competing firm.\n\nGiven these new payoffs, let's create a 2x2 payoff matrix for this scenario.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (25,25), (22,30) ],\n [ (30,22), (18,18) ]]",
