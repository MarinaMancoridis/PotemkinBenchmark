    "inferences": "To illustrate the concept of Strict Dominance, we revise the example with clearer strategies and outcomes.\n\nImagine a simple two-player game: Player 1 is deciding where to have dinner, and Player 2 is a randomly behaving customer who influences the wait time at each location.\n\nPlayer 1's strategies are:\n- Strategy H: Go to Life Alive in Harvard Square.\n- Strategy C: Go to Life Alive in Central Square.\n\nPlayer 2 (the random customer)'s strategies affect the wait times at these locations:\n- Strategy 0: Choose a behavior that results in no wait at Central Square.\n- Strategy 10: Choose a behavior that causes a 10-minute wait at Central Square.\n\nThe payoffs for Player 1 are the negatives of wait time (as they prefer shorter waits), while Player 2 does not care about the payoffs in this scenario but influences the outcomes.\n\nLet's construct a payoff matrix where: \n- If Player 1 chooses H, their wait is always 0 minutes (payoff 0).\n- If Player 1 chooses C, their wait depends on Player 2's choice (0 or -10).\n\nThus, the payoff matrix reflecting strict dominance is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{Player 1} \\backslash \\text{Player 2} & \\text{0 minutes wait} & \\text{10 minutes wait} \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{H} & (0, x) & (0, y) \\\\\n\\text{C} & (0, x) & (-10, y) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nChoices and payoffs for Player 2 (x and y) are not relevant for demonstrating strict dominance, as Player 1 always has a better (less negative/more positive) payoff going to Harvard Square (strategy H), regardless of Player 2's action, making strategy H strictly dominant.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 0), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (-10, 0) ]]\n",
