Here's the revised scenario:\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT. My brother doesn't care much about the buildings and is equally likely to go to either. I, on the other hand, prefer to meet my brother regardless of the building, but, given the choice, I prefer being in building 52. So I should consider whether being with my brother outweighs my building preference.\n\nNow, let's construct a payoff matrix that reflects these conditions without strict dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (1,2) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
