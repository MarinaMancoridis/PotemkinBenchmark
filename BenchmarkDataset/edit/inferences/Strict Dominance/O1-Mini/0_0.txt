    "inferences": "To transform the scenario described into one that does not exhibit strict dominance, we need to modify the conditions such that neither option (Harvard Square or Central Square) consistently has a better outcome regardless of the choices of others.\n\nCurrently, the Harvard Square cafe strictly dominates Central Square because it always has a zero wait time, whereas Central Square has a wait time ranging between 5 and 10 minutes. To break this strict dominance, we could introduce a variable that affects the wait time at the Harvard Square cafe under certain conditions, without making it worse than Central Square.\n\nFor example, we could assume that on certain days, due to unforeseen events, the wait at the Harvard Square location can also range from 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nRevised Scenario: \n\nI'm considering dining at either the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square. Both cafes have the same menu, and my decision hinges on the wait time at each location. Typically, there's no wait at the Harvard Square cafe due to its large kitchen. However, on weekends, the cafe hosts a popular event that attracts a crowd, leading to wait times between 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the Central Square cafe's wait time consistently varies between 5 and 10 minutes based on attendance.\n\nIn this revised scenario, neither location has a strictly dominant strategy, as the wait times overlap under certain conditions. This prevents one location from always being the superior choice regardless of how others make their dining decisions, eliminating strict dominance from the decision-making process. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,5), (0,10) ],\n [ (5,0), (10,0) ]]\n",
