    "inferences": "To make this example an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to ensure that a change in policy (from the current scenario where no taxes are collected) could make at least one party better off without making anyone else worse off. \n\nIn the given situation, since everyone agrees that having some taxes is better than having none, we can construct a scenario where a compromise policy is implemented \u2014 say, one that involves a moderate tax on both the rich and the poor. This compromise allows taxes to be collected, thereby funding the government, and improves the welfare of both groups compared to the status quo of no taxation.\n\nLet's redefine the scenario to reflect this:\n\n- Two thirds of the country supports a higher taxation rate on the rich.\n- One third of the country supports a higher taxation rate on the poor.\n- A compromise is reached where moderate taxation is applied evenly to both income groups: the rich and the poor.\n\nIn this compromise, taxes are collected, thus improving funding for the government's functions, which everyone prefers, and the taxation burdens are distributed in a way that neither group is strictly worse off than having no taxes at all. This revamped scenario reflects Pareto Optimality: the policy change makes everyone better off (or at least no worse off) compared to no taxes being collected.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (2,2) ],\n [ (1,3), (4,0) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
