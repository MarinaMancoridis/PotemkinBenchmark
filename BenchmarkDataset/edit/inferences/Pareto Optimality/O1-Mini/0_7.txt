    "inferences": "To transform this situation into one where Pareto Optimality is achieved, we need to adjust the scenario so that no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. \n\nIn the initial scenario, nobody puts money into the pot. Let's modify it such that a Pareto Optimal outcome is reached when all 10 people put their money into the pot. Here's how this can be done:\n\nEach of the 10 people contributes $1 to the pot. The pot then doubles to $20. Each person receives $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the $20, resulting in each person getting $2 back. This is a better outcome for everyone compared to putting in nothing and receiving nothing, and no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.\n\nTherefore, the scenario becomes:\n\n1. Each of the 10 people puts in $1.\n2. The pot doubles to $20.\n3. Each person receives $2 back.\n\nThis outcome is Pareto Optimal because moving to any other outcome (such as no one putting in money or someone choosing not to put in money) would result in at least one person being worse off.\n\nFor this situation to be a 2x2 payoff matrix example with Pareto Optimality, let's consider two players (Person 1 and Person 2) where each has two strategies: to participate (put in $1) or not participate (put in $0). A Pareto Optimal outcome can be designed so that if both participate, their returns are maximized collectively, and if no additional utility can be gained without sacrificing the payoff of another player.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
