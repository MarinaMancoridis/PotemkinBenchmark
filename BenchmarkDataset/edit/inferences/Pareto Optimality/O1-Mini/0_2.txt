    "inferences": "To modify the example so that it is not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to change the scenario to one where at least one member of the band can be made better off without making anyone else worse off. Pareto Optimality implies that you cannot improve one person's situation without worsening another's. In this case, to make it not Pareto Optimal, we should have a situation where the band can switch to a different venue option that improves some members' payoffs without decreasing the lead singer's payoff.\n\nHere's a modified scenario:\n\nThe lead singer of a band somewhat prefers large venues, but also enjoys small venues. Everyone else in the band strongly prefers small venues. The band\u2019s booking agent can choose either, so sometimes they play small venues as a compromise.\n\nIn this scenario, by occasionally playing at small venues, the band can potentially improve the payoffs for the other members without significantly decreasing the payoff for the lead singer, assuming the lead singer's preference for large venues is slight. This means the situation isn't Pareto Optimal since you can improve the others' satisfaction without a cost to the lead singer that they find significant.\n\nNow, let's construct a 2x2 payoff matrix where a similar dynamic occurs but isn't Pareto Optimal. In this fictional game, consider two strategies for each player: Strategy 1 - always play large venues and Strategy 2 - play a mix of large and small venues.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (3,2), (3,3) ],\n [ (2,3), (3,3) ]]",
