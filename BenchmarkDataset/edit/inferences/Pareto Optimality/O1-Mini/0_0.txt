    "inferences": "To change the example so that the allocation is not Pareto Optimal, we need to make it possible to improve one player's allocation without making the other player's allocation worse.\n\nIn the given allocation, A receives 2 bananas and 1 apple, while B receives 1 banana and 2 apples. This is considered Pareto optimal because any change to give one player more fruit would result in the other player receiving less, assuming both prefer bananas.\n\nTo make the situation not Pareto Optimal, consider an allocation where there is still room for improvement without detriment to the other player. Here's how we can adjust it:\n\nA receives 3 apples (which are less preferred) and 0 bananas, while B receives 0 apples and 3 bananas. In this case, it is possible to redistribute the fruits to improve A's satisfaction by giving some bananas to A while still maintaining B's preference for bananas, making it non-Pareto Optimal.\n\nNow, let's create a payoff matrix that isn't Pareto Optimal:\n\nFor the matrix, let's consider two strategies for each player. Each pair of strategies results in different payoffs, intentionally designed so that not every strategy combination is Pareto Optimal, allowing at least one strategy profile to be improved upon without harming the other player's payoff.\n\nDefine Strategies:\n- Player 1 Strategies: S1, S2\n- Player 2 Strategies: T1, T2\n\nWe want at least one allocation to have room for mutual improvement. Define integer payoffs for each strategy profile such that this condition is met.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,3) ],\n [ (3,0), (1,1) ]]\n",
