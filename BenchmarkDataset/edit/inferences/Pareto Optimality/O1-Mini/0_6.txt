    "inferences": "To make the given situation not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to create a situation where an improvement can be made for at least one individual without making others worse off.\n\nHere is a modified scenario:\n\nA group of 10 people has the opportunity to put $1 into a multiplying pot which doubles the money a single time. However, the pot only doubles the money for up to 8 people. If all 10 people put their money in, only 8 randomly selected individuals get back double the amount they put in, while the remaining 2 individuals lose their $1 completely. \n\nIn this revised situation, it's not Pareto Optimal because not everyone who contributes is guaranteed a return, leaving room for improvements. For example, if the rules were changed to either guarantee a return for everyone or limit contributions to just 8 people, it could potentially improve the outcome for those who would otherwise lose money.\n\nNow, let's create a 2x2 payoff matrix for a new situation.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (3,4), (1,2) ],\n [ (0,5), (2,3) ]]",
