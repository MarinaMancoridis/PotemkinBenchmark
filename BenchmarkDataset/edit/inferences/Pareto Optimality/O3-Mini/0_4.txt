    "inferences": "To change the example so that it is no longer an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to ensure that an improvement can be made for at least one party without making anyone else worse off. In the original example, the outcome (taxing the poor) is Pareto Optimal because changing the policy to tax the rich instead (desired by two-thirds of the population) makes the lobbying group worse off due to their preference for their own policy.\n\nConsider a new scenario:\n\nInstead of two distinct groups with opposing preferences, imagine three groups in the country:\n\n1. Group A (40% of the population) prefers the policy to tax the rich.\n2. Group B (40% of the population) prefers the policy to tax both the rich and the poor equally.\n3. Group C (20% of the population) prefers the policy to tax the poor.\n\nCurrently, the policy to exclusively tax the poor is enacted due to Group C's lobbying power. This is not Pareto Optimal because changing the policy to tax both groups equally, preferred by Group B, would make Group A happier without making Group B or Group C worse off (assuming both taxes raise the required government funding without affecting lobbying power or economic efficiency).\n\nNow, we can illustrate the situation with a payoff matrix. Assume each group's preference results in a payoff of 1 if their preferred policy is enacted, and 0 otherwise. Since we are considering how changing the policy can improve at least one group's payoff without reducing another's, observe the following payoff matrix representation:\n\n- Policy 1 (Tax both equally): Group A gains some satisfaction (payoff of 1) due to equal taxation; Group B gets their preferred policy; Group C remains neutral or indifferent.\n- Policy 2 (Tax the poor): Only Group C gets their preferred outcome, making it worse for A and B.\n\nTo meet these conditions in a numerical payoff matrix, let's consider a game scenario with players and strategies without explicit context. We'll ensure it\u2019s not Pareto Optimal by finding a way to improve one player's payoff without harming the other player.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (2,0), (1,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
