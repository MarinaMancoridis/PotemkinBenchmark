    "inferences": "To make this example not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to introduce an outcome where reallocating resources could make at least one individual better off without making anyone worse off.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nA group of 10 people has the opportunity to put $1 into a multiplying pot which doubles the money a single time. However, instead of each person getting out the multiplied money they specifically put in, all the multiplied money is pooled together, and only 8 out of the 10 people will be chosen at random to get back any returns. The 2 people who are not chosen will receive nothing from the pot. This situation leaves room for potential Pareto improvements because it is possible to redistribute the money such that all individuals could end up better off, unlike the original scenario where everyone always received exactly double what they put in with no room for improvement without harming someone else.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,1), (1,1) ]]\n",
