    "inferences": "To make the scenario an instance of Pareto Optimality, we have to adjust the allocation of money so that no individual's situation can be improved without worsening another's situation. In game theory, Pareto Optimality means that resources are allocated in the most efficient way, where it is impossible to reallocate without making at least one individual worse off.\n\nLet's adjust the example:\n\nEach of the 10 people decides to put $1 into the pot, resulting in $10 being doubled to $20. The $20 is then equally divided among the 10 people, giving each person $2.\n\nThis new scenario is Pareto optimal because:\n- If any individual chooses not to put in their $1, they would still receive a portion of the pot, potentially resulting in less total output if others don't contribute either.\n- Given everyone contributes, the generated outcome is distributed efficiently, and any attempt to change the distribution or contributions without reducing someone else's payoff is not possible.\n\nPareto Optimality in this adjusted example is reached because everyone maximizes their gain given the contributions, and no further changes can improve one person's payoff without reducing another's.\n\nLet's now represent a payoff matrix that reflects the concept of Pareto Optimality in a simple 2x2 format. We'll represent two strategies for each player: \"Contribute\" and \"Do Not Contribute.\"\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,1) ]]\n",
