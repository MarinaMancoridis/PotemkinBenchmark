    "inferences": "To make the allocation not a Pareto Optimal solution, we need to create a scenario where it's possible to make both A and B better off. Originally, A receives 2 bananas and 1 apple, and B receives 1 banana and 2 apples. Both prefer bananas, so let's adjust the allocation so that it's possible to reach a better outcome for both.\n\nConsider the initial non-Pareto optimal allocation:\n- A receives 1 banana and 2 apples.\n- B receives 2 bananas and 1 apple.\n\nIn this scenario, both A and B prefer bananas. A has 1 banana and B has 2, so let's assume B values an additional banana more than A does, and A values bananas significantly more.\n\nNow, let's introduce a possible distribution that improves the situation for both:\nSuppose A receives 2 bananas and 1 apple, while B receives 1 banana and 2 apples. In this adjusted outcome, both players can end up with a preferable distribution based on their preference for bananas. Hence, the previous allocation was not Pareto Optimal, and we've demonstrated a simple reallocation that allows for improvement, reverting back to the original distribution meant to be optimal.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,2), (3,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
