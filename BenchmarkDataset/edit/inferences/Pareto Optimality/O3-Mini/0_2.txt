    "inferences": "To change this example so that it is not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to create a situation where there is an alternative choice that would make at least one member better off without making anyone else worse off. \n\nCurrently, the lead singer prefers large venues, while everyone else prefers small venues, and they only play large venues. This setup is Pareto Optimal because you can't make everyone else better off (by choosing small venues) without making the lead singer worse off.\n\nTo make it non-Pareto Optimal:\n\nLet's say the lead singer actually doesn't have a strong preference and slightly prefers large venues just for clout but would be perfectly happy with small venues as well, and all other band members strongly prefer small venues. However, they still only play large venues.\n\nIn this new scenario, if the band were to switch to small venues, it would make everyone else in the band better off and would only slightly inconvenience the lead singer, or possibly not affect them at all if their preference is almost neutral. Therefore, switching to small venues is a Pareto improvement, making the current situation not Pareto Optimal.\n\nLet's illustrate the payoff matrix reflecting these conditions. Currently, they play large venues which makes the rest of the band unhappy while the lead singer is slightly happier. If they were to switch to small venues, it would improve the payoff for everyone except the lead singer only slightly.  \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (6,4) ],\n [ (6,4), (5,5) ]]\n",
