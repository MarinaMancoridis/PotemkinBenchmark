    "inferences": "To ensure the situation described does not achieve Pareto Optimality, we need to adjust the scenario so that it's possible to improve one person's outcome without making anyone else worse off. In the original example, each individual receives exactly their multiplied contribution, making it Pareto Optimal as no individual's situation can be improved without worsening another's.\n\nLet's modify this: Suppose now that instead of all the money being doubled and then returned exactly as contributed, the total pot is divided unequally or there's a mechanism where not all participants necessarily get back what they doubled, hence the situation isn't Pareto Optimal.\n\nFor instance, let's introduce an unequal sharing mechanism such as a lottery:\n\nA group of 10 people has the opportunity to put $1 into a multiplying pot which doubles the total money to $20. However, the pot is divided among 3 randomly chosen winners only. The winners do not receive an equal share; they could receive varying amounts such as $8, $7, and $5, and the rest receive nothing. Here, the situation isn't Pareto Optimal because any redistribution favoring one group of participants might make others worse off, and multiple configurations could make some better off without detriment.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (2,0), (0,1) ], \n [ (3,2), (1,1) ]]",
