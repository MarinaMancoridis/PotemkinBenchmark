Here is the modified example:\n\nC has a moderate preference for both fancy and casual restaurants, valuing the experience equally. Her partner D strongly prefers casual restaurants and dislikes fancy restaurants. Currently, they always eat at fancy restaurants because C is in charge of making reservations. This arrangement is not Pareto Optimal because if they choose to eat at casual restaurants instead, D would be better off and C would still be just as satisfied.\n\nNow, let's construct a payoff matrix that illustrates the above scenario, explicitly showing that the current choice is not Pareto Optimal by demonstrating there is an alternative where one player's payoff can improve without worsening the other's. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (2,3) ],\n [ (3,3), (2,4) ]]\n",
