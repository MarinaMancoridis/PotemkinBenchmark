    "inferences": "To transform this example into an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to adjust the situation such that the outcome cannot be improved upon without making at least one individual worse off. \n\nLet's modify the scenario as follows:\n\nSuppose the 10 people each have $1. If they invest in the pot, their money doubles. If everyone contributes their $1, the pot will have $20, and each person will receive $2, which is a better outcome for all compared to not contributing and keeping the $1.\n\nNow, if even one person decides not to invest, the pot will still double whatever amount is invested, but the returns will be shared among all. Therefore, if everyone except one person invests their $1 and the 9 people who invest receive $1.90 each (as the pot has $19 doubled to $38, and each receives $3.80), while the person who does not invest receives only their $1 share.\n\nIn this modified scenario, assuming every person prefers to end up with $2 rather than anything less, the allocation where everyone invests and receives $2 each is Pareto Optimal. No one can be made better off without making at least one other person worse off from this $2 each status. \n\nThis condition ensures a Pareto Optimal outcome where the total benefit is maximized, and any deviation would harm at least one participant's outcome.\n\nNext, let's construct a payoff matrix with a Pareto Optimal outcome.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
