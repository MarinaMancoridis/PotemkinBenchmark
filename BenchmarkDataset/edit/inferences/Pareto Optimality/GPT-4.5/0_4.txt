    "inferences": "To make this situation not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we would need to adjust the conditions such that the resulting policy doesn't leave everyone as well off (or better off) as they can be without making someone else worse off.\n\nOriginal scenario:\n- Two-thirds of the country supports taxing the rich.\n- One-third supports taxing the poor.\n- Everyone prefers some taxes to no taxes.\n\nFor the scenario to be considered Pareto Optimal, a policy is enacted where no one can be made better off without making at least one person worse off. In this case, taxing the rich, which is the preference of the majority, would likely be Pareto Optimal as it satisfies the majority's preference without necessarily harming the minority preference (since they also prefer some taxes over none).\n\nTo alter it, assume the policy enacted benefits the minority (the second group) disproportionately and harms the majority while removing funds from necessary government programs that even the minority enjoys:\n\nNew scenario:\n- The policy enacted raises taxes on the poor and reduces them on the rich.\n- This policy not only ignores the preference of the majority but also detracts from the necessary funds that are vital for public goods that even the minority enjoys.\n- As a result, the overall welfare is harmed, and the preferences of the majority are entirely bypassed.\n  \nIn this new setup, no one can be said to be in a Pareto Optimal situation because there is room to improve at least one individual's (or group's) welfare without harming others, namely by shifting back to a tax system closer to the majority's preference or by funding necessary programs enhancing societal welfare at large.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,4), (3,3) ],\n [ (2,0), (4,2) ]]\n",
