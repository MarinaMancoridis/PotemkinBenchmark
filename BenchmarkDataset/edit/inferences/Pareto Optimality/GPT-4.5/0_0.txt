Therefore, the new distribution is not Pareto Optimal since the original allocation can still be adjusted without making both worse off.\n\nNow, let's construct a 2x2 payoff matrix that does not exhibit Pareto Optimality by ensuring there's an option in the matrix that can make one player's situation better without worsening the other's position.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,5), (4,4) ],\n [ (2,6), (3,3) ]]\n",
