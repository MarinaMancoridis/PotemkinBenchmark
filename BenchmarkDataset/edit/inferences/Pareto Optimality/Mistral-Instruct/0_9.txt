The payoff matrix represents their preferences for restaurant types.\n\n- C's preference for fancy restaurants is represented by the value 3, and for casual restaurants by 1.\n- D's preference for casual restaurants is represented by the value 4, and for fancy restaurants by 0.\n\nC's default choice of fancy restaurants is represented by the first row of the matrix. D's preference for casual restaurants is represented by the second column of the matrix.\n\n- If C chooses a fancy restaurant (first row), her payoff is 3, and D's payoff is 0 (since he prefers casual restaurants).\n- If C chooses a casual restaurant (second row), her payoff is 1, and D's payoff is 4 (since he prefers casual restaurants).\n\nSimilarly, for D:\n\n- If C chooses a fancy restaurant (first row), his payoff is 0, and C's payoff is 3.\n- If C chooses a casual restaurant (second row), his payoff is 4, and C's payoff is 1.\n\nNow, let's find the Pareto-optimal solutions:\n\n- A Pareto-optimal solution is a combination of strategies where no player can unilaterally improve their payoff without making the other player worse off.\n- In this case, the Pareto-optimal solutions are the cells in the matrix where neither player can improve their payoff without decreasing the other player's payoff.\n- The Pareto-optimal solutions are (1,3) and (0,4).\n\nBy choosing a casual restaurant (second row), both players can achieve a Pareto-optimal outcome. However, C's default choice of fancy restaurants (first row) is not Pareto-optimal, as D can improve his payoff by choosing a casual restaurant (second row) without decreasing C's payoff.\n\nThis example demonstrates that C's default choice of fancy restaurants is not Pareto-optimal, as there exists a better outcome for both players (a Pareto-optimal solution) where C chooses a casual restaurant (second row).\n<</OUTPUT>",
