    "inferences": "To represent this scenario as an instance of Pareto Optimality, we can create a 2x2 payoff matrix that shows the utility each player gains from different combinations of apples and bananas. Since both A and B prefer bananas, let's assume that they get a higher utility from bananas compared to apples.\n\nHere's the payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (3, 4), (1, 1) ],\n [ (0, 0), (2, 3) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each pair represents Player 1's utility, and the second number represents Player 2's utility. The first row represents the payoff when each player takes 1 banana and 1 apple, and the second row represents the payoff when both players take only apples.\n\nIn this case, the initial division of 1 banana and 1 apple (3, 4) is a Pareto Optimal solution, as no other outcome can make both players better off without making at least one player worse off. If either player were to get more bananas, the other player would be worse off, and vice versa. This is a key characteristic of Pareto Optimal solutions.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 4), (1, 1) ],\n [ (0, 0), (2, 3) ]]",
