If both contribute, the pot doubles to $20. Each person gets one tenth of the total, resulting in a payoff of $2 for each person.\n\n2. If both do not contribute, the pot remains at $10, and each person gets one tenth of the total, resulting in a payoff of $1 for each person.\n\nNow, let's create the payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (2, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (1, 1), (2, 2) ]]\n\nIn this payoff matrix, both strategies are Pareto Optimal because no other strategy can make one player better off without making the other player worse off. However, if we want to encourage more contributions, we can introduce an external incentive, such as a reward for contributing, to make one strategy strictly dominant.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (1, 1), (2, 2) ]]",
