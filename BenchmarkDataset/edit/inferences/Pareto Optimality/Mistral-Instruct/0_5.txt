This represents the Pareto Optimal outcome where both players are better off compared to the status quo (no taxes).\n\t+ If Player 1 (majority) insists on taxing the rich (top-left cell) and Player 2 (minority) insists on taxing the poor (top-right cell), both players are worse off compared to Player 1 getting their preferred policy (taxing the rich) and Player 2 getting a slightly better payoff than the status quo (no taxes, bottom-right cell).\n\t+ If Player 1 (majority) insists on taxing the rich (top-left cell) and Player 2 (minority) agrees to tax the rich (bottom-left cell), Player 1 gets their preferred policy but Player 2 gets a lower payoff than the status quo (no taxes, bottom-right cell).\n\t+ If Player 1 (majority) agrees to tax the poor (bottom-left cell) and Player 2 (minority) insists on taxing the poor (top-right cell), both players are worse off compared to Player 2 getting their preferred policy (taxing the poor) and Player 1 getting a slightly better payoff than the status quo (no taxes, bottom-right cell).\n* Since there is no Pareto Improvement possible (no cell where both players can be made better off without making at least one player worse off), the status quo (no taxes) is a Pareto Optimal outcome. However, the top-left cell represents a Pareto Optimal outcome that both players could agree upon if they were to negotiate.",
