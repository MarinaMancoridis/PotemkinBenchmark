The booking agent listens to the lead singer, so they play in venues that offer a higher payoff to the lead singer but a lower payoff to the rest of the band.\n\nIn the 2x2 payoff matrix, Player 1 represents the lead singer and Player 2 represents the rest of the band. The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs for each player. In this case, the lead singer gets a higher payoff (5 units) if they play in a large venue (A1), but the rest of the band gets a higher payoff (4 units) if they play in a small venue (B3). Conversely, the lead singer gets a lower payoff (2 units) if they play in a small venue (A2), but the rest of the band gets a higher payoff (3 units) if they play in a large venue (B4). This setup ensures that the game is not Pareto optimal, as one player can be made better off without making the other player worse off by switching from a large venue to a small venue.",
