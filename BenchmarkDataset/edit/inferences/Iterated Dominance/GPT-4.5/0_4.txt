    "inferences": "To alter the example so that it is not an instance of iterated dominance, we need to ensure that no strategy strictly dominates another. This means each strategy should have a situation where it is the best response to the opponent's strategy. \n\nLet's redefine the payoffs:\n\n1. If one plays scissors and the other plays rock, rock gets 0 points and scissors gets 3 points.\n2. If one plays scissors and the other plays paper, paper gets 2 points, and scissors gets 1 point.\n3. If both players play scissors, both win 1 point.\n4. If one plays rock and the other plays paper, rock wins 1 point, and paper wins 0 points.\n5. If both play rock, both win 2 points.\n6. If both play paper, both win 3 points.\n\nThis way, no single strategy strictly dominates another for either player. Each choice has situations where it is better or equally good compared to the alternatives depending on what the other player chooses. Thus, the best strategy cannot be determined purely by elimination of dominated strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0,3), (3,0) ],\n [ (3,0), (2,2), (1,2) ],\n [ (0,3), (2,1), (1,1) ]],\n[[ (1,1), (0,3), (3,0) ],\n [ (3,0), (2,2), (1,2) ],\n [ (0,3), (2,1), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
