    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of iterated dominance, we have to ensure that there are no strictly dominated strategies for you, the player trying to decide between the two cafes. In the original scenario, diners strictly prefer going to Life Alive in Central Square due to the incredibly long lines at other restaurants, potentially making one option strictly dominated. We can modify the scenario in the following way:\n\nConsider that the wait in Harvard Square is not fixed at 5 minutes, but varies depending on some unrelated factor (e.g., it can be either 5 or 15 minutes with some probability). This uncertainty prevents one option from strictly dominating, as there's a condition under which either option might be better depending on how long the wait turns out to be.\n\nWith this modification, your decision is no longer clear-cut, and iterated dominance cannot be applied straightforwardly as there are no strategies that are strictly dominated across all possible scenarios. Without a clear strictly dominated strategy being present, this modification effectively nullifies the use of iterated dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (5,10), (10,20) ],\n [ (1,10), (6,5), (11,0) ],\n [ (2,20), (7,15), (12,10) ]],\n\n[[ (0,0), (5,10), (10,20) ],\n [ (1,10), (6,5), (11,0) ]],\n\n[[ (0,0), (5,10) ],\n [ (1,10), (6,5) ]]\n",
