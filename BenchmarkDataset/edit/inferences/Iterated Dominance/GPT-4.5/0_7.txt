Therefore, Action A can be eliminated for Player 2.\n\nUpdated Matrix after eliminating strictly dominated strategies for Player 2:\n\nFirst Iteration:\n```\n[[ (0,3) ],\n [ (1,1) ]]\n```\n\nIn this updated matrix, each player has only one remaining action. Since no further strictly dominated strategies exist, this matrix serves as the final stable payoff matrix.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,0), (0,3) ], [ (2,2), (1,1) ]], [[ (0,3) ], [ (1,1) ]]\n",
