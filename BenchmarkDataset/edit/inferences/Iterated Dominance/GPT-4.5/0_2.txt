    "inferences": "To change this scenario so that it is not an instance of iterated dominance, you could modify the preferences and available strategies of the individuals involved. In iterated dominance, one strategy is strictly better than others regardless of the opponent's choice. To avoid this, ensure that each decision has a counterbalance where no strictly dominating strategy exists without additional information or assumptions.\n\nHere's a revised version of the scenario:\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT. He has recently started enjoying his time at building 52 because it has a new exhibit and is equally likely to choose building 45 or 52 independently of my actions. As for me, right now I value meeting him and visiting the exhibit equally, hence prefer meeting him regardless of the building, but might choose to visit building 52 if I think he would enjoy it as well. Which building should I go to in order to try and find my brother?\n\nIn this revised scenario, his choice does not strictly dominate going to building 45 or 52 as he enjoys both locations equally, and my choice similarly has a balance of preferences, meaning there is no dominated strategy based on iterated dominance.",
