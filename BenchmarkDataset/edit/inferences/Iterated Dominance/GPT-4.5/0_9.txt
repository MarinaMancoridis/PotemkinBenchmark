    "inferences": "To apply the game theory concept of iterated dominance, we first need to construct a payoff matrix for both firms, depicting their potential payoffs based on their advertising choices.\n\nConsider the following scenarios for payoff calculation:\n\n1. **Both Advertise:**\n\n   - My Firm: Sales ($30 million) - Advertising Cost ($35 million) = -$5 million\n   - Competitor: Sales ($30 million) - Advertising Cost ($35 million) = -$5 million\n\n2. **My Firm Advertises, Competitor Does Not:**\n\n   - My Firm: Sales ($50 million) - Advertising Cost ($35 million) = $15 million\n   - Competitor: $0 million\n\n3. **Competitor Advertises, My Firm Does Not:**\n\n   - My Firm: $0 million\n   - Competitor: Sales ($50 million) - Advertising Cost ($35 million) = $15 million\n\n4. **Neither Advertises:**\n\n   - My Firm: $10 million\n   - Competitor: $10 million\n\nUsing the above scenarios, let's create the initial payoff matrix. Let \"A\" denote \"Advertise\" and \"NA\" denote \"Not Advertise\". Player 1 (rows) represents my firm, and Player 2 (columns) represents the competitor firm.\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n```\n[[(-5, -5), (15, 0)],\n [(0, 15), (10, 10)]]\n```\n\nNext, let's apply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\n1. Check rows for my firm:\n   - For my firm, \"Advertise\" is strictly dominated by \"Not Advertise\" because 10 > -5 and 10 > 0.\n\n2. Eliminate the strictly dominated strategy for my firm. Remove the first row.\n\nIntermediate Payoff Matrix:\n```\n[[(0, 15), (10, 10)]]\n```\n\nNow check columns for the competitor:\n\n1. For the competitor, \"Advertise\" is strictly dominated by \"Not Advertise\" because 10 > 15.\n\n2. Eliminate the strictly dominated strategy for the competitor. Remove the first column.\n\nFinal Payoff Matrix:\n```\n[[ (10, 10) ]]\n```\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(-5, -5), (15, 0)], \n [(0, 15), (10, 10)]], \n[[(0, 15), (10, 10)]], \n[[ (10, 10) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
