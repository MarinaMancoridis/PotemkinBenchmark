    "inferences": "To turn the game of modified rock-paper-scissors into an instance of iterated dominance, we will construct a payoff matrix that shows the players' strategies and payoffs. Based on the given scoring rules, we need to first represent the game with its initial payoff matrix, and then iteratively eliminate strictly dominated strategies until no such strategies remain.\n\nInitially, the payoff matrix based on the described rules will be structured for Player 1 (rows) and Player 2 (columns) with available strategies: Rock (R), Paper (P), and Scissors (S). The payoffs are denoted as (Player 1, Player 2):\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n```\n[[ (1,1), (3,2), (-10,0) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1), (0,1) ],\n [ (0,-10),(0,0), (0,0) ]]\n```\n\nHere, strictly dominated strategies are identified and removed. For example, a strategy is strictly dominated if there exists another strategy that always provides a better payoff regardless of the opponent's choice. The process is then iterated:\n\n1. **Iteration 1:**\n   - For Player 1, strategy \"Scissors\" (row 3) is strictly dominated by \"Rock\" (row 1) because Rock gives higher or equal payoff in all columns (opponent strategies).\n   - Remove the \"Scissors\" strategy for Player 1:\n   ```\n   [[ (1,1), (3,2), (-10,0) ],\n    [ (2,3), (1,1), (0,1) ]]\n   ```\n\n2. **Iteration 2:**\n   - For Player 2, strategy \"Scissors\" (column 3) is strictly dominated by \"Rock\" (column 1) because Rock gives higher or equal payoff in all rows (own strategies).\n   - Remove the \"Scissors\" strategy for Player 2:\n   ```\n   [[ (1,1), (3,2) ],\n    [ (2,3), (1,1) ]]\n   ```\n\n3. **Iteration 3:**\n   - For Player 1, no strategies are strictly dominated.\n   - For Player 2, strategy \"Paper\" (column 2) is strictly dominated by \"Rock\" (column 1).\n   - Remove the \"Paper\" strategy for Player 2:\n   ```\n   [[ (1,1) ],\n    [ (2,3) ]]\n   ```\n\n4. **Iteration 4:**\n   - Both players have only one remaining strategy. No further dominance elimination is possible.\n\nThe resulting payoff matrix after iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies is:\n```\n[[ (1,1) ]]\n```\n\nThus, the final solution suggests an equilibrium where both players play \"Rock,\" each receiving a payoff of 1 point. In this simplified scenario, using iterated dominance, the optimal strategy for both players is to play \"Rock.\"\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (3,2), (-10,0) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1), (0,1) ],\n [ (0,-10),(0,0), (0,0) ]],\n[[ (1,1), (3,2), (-10,0) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1), (0,1) ]],\n[[ (1,1), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1) ]],\n[[ (1,1) ],\n [ (2,3) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
