    "inferences": "To construct an example that is not an instance of iterated dominance, we need payoff conditions where no strategy is strictly dominated. Let's use a payoff structure such that no single decision (to advertise or not advertise) is unconditionally better for either firm regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n- If both firms advertise, the firms will both incur their advertising costs and generate revenues of $30 million. \n- If one firm advertises but the other does not, the advertising firm has higher revenue potential due to increased market capture.\n- If both firms choose not to advertise, they will still maintain a baseline revenue but miss out on potential gains from advertising.\n\nRevised Payoff Matrix might look like this:\n\nFor my firm (Firm A) and competitor firm (Firm B), the payoffs could be as follows considering net gains:\n\n- If both advertise: \n   - My firm: $30M - $35M (cost) = -$5M \n   - Competitor firm: $30M - $60M (cost) = -$30M\n- If my firm advertises and the competitor does not:\n   - My firm: $50M - $35M (cost) = $15M\n   - Competitor firm: $0M (net) = $0M\n- If my firm does not advertise and the competitor does:\n   - My firm: $0M (net) = $0M\n   - Competitor firm: $50M - $60M (cost) = -$10M\n- If neither advertises:\n   - Both firms: $10M (net, as no advertising cost involved)\n\nWith this setup, the gains and losses don't lead to strict dominance due to negative returns or break-even options. Hence, this setup is not subject to iterated dominance elimination.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-5,-30), (15,0) ],\n [ (0,-10), (10,10) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
