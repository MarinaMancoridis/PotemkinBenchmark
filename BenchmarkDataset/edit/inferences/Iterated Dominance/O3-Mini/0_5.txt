    "inferences": "To convert the given example into an instance that demonstrates the concept of Iterated Dominance, we first need to represent the game in a payoff matrix and then iteratively eliminate strictly dominated strategies until no further eliminations can be made.\n\nLet's first define the payoff matrix with the given rules. We'll use the convention where the first payoff in each pair is for Player 1 and the second for Player 2. We'll label the strategies as (R)ock, (P)aper, (S)cissors. Here's the initial payoff matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}\n & R & P & S \\\\\n\\hline\nR & (1, 1) & (3, 2) & (-10, 0) \\\\\nP & (2, 3) & (1, 1) & (0, 1) \\\\\nS & (0, -10) & (1, 0) & (0, 0) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n1. Now, let's check for dominance:\n   - In the first row (Player 1 playing Rock):\n     - Comparing the payoffs for Player 1's strategies: \n       - Rock against Paper gives 3, and Paper against Paper gives 1, so Paper dominates Rock.\n   - In the second row (Player 1 playing Paper):\n     - Comparing against Scissors column, Paper gives 0, while Rock gives -10, so Paper dominates Scissors.\n\n2. We eliminate the Rock and Scissors strategies for Player 1: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n & P \\\\\n\\hline\nP & (1, 1) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n3. Re-evaluating for Player 2:\n   - The remaining strategy for Player 1 is Paper. \n   - In this strategy, Player 2 receives 1 payoff. Since this matrix already has no strictly dominated strategies, it stands as is.\n\nThe final outcome is a stable strategy set based on iterated dominance, showing the optimal play for both players if they fully eliminate dominated options. From the reduced matrix, both players will choose Paper for an equal payoff, showing an equilibrium state where no better individual deviations exist.\n\nThe strategy to play for both players is Paper based on the final analysis. \n\nNow, generating the list of payoff matrices showing each step of elimination process:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1, 1), (3, 2), (-10, 0) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1), (0, 1) ],\n [ (0, -10), (1, 0), (0, 0) ]],\n[[ (1, 1), (3, 2), (-10, 0) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1), (0, 1) ]],\n[[ (1, 1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
