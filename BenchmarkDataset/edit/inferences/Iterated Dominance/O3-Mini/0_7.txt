    "inferences": "To transform this game into an instance of iterated dominance, we must define payoff matrices where strictly dominated strategies can be repeatedly eliminated. We'll construct a series of matrices demonstrating this iterative process. \n\nInitially, we'll introduce three pure strategies for both players, where some strategies are strictly dominated by others. The payoff will be adjusted such that each iteration eliminates a dominated strategy until no strictly dominated strategies remain.\n\nLet's start by creating an initial 3x3 matrix consistent with the problem description:\n\n1st Matrix:\n[[ (4, 1), (0, 3), (3, 4) ],\n [ (2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 3) ],\n [ (3, 0), (2, 4), (0, 2) ]]\n\n- In this matrix, for Player 1, Strategy 1 strictly dominates Strategy 3. Similarly, for Player 2, Strategy 3 strictly dominates Strategy 1. By eliminating these dominated strategies, we derive a reduced payoff matrix.\n\n2nd Matrix:\n[[ (4, 1), (0, 3) ],\n [ (2, 2), (1, 1) ]]\n\n- Here, for Player 1, Strategy 1 strictly dominates Strategy 2. We eliminate Strategy 2 for Player 1.\n\n3rd Matrix:\n[[ (4, 1), (0, 3) ]]\n\n- Finally, no more dominated strategies can be removed. Both players are left with a single strategy, resulting in the final reduced matrix.\n\nLet's present this sequence as a list of matrices to demonstrate iterated elimination:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4, 1), (0, 3), (3, 4) ],\n [ (2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 3) ],\n [ (3, 0), (2, 4), (0, 2) ]],\n[[ (4, 1), (0, 3) ],\n [ (2, 2), (1, 1) ]],\n[[ (4, 1), (0, 3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
