    "inferences": "To make the game not an instance of Iterated Dominance, we must ensure that there are no strategies that are strictly dominated by others or can be eliminated through such a process. This means setting up payoffs such that no single strategy is always worse than another regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nLet's construct an example payoff matrix for a modified game that doesn't allow for iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\nAssume the strategies are labeled as R (Rock), P (Paper), and S (Scissors).\n\n- If both play Rock, they both get 2 points.\n- Rock vs. Paper: Rock gets 3, Paper gets 4.\n- Rock vs. Scissors: Rock gets 2, Scissors gets 1.\n- Paper vs. Scissors: Paper gets 0, Scissors gets 3.\n- If both play Paper, both get 1 point.\n- If both play Scissors, both get 2 points.\n\nThe payoff matrix for this setup would look like the following:\n\n```\n       R    P    S\n    +---------------\nR | (2,2) (3,4) (2,1)\nP | (4,3) (1,1) (0,3)\nS | (1,2) (3,0) (2,2)\n```\n\nIn this matrix, no strategy is strictly dominated by another for either player:\n\n- Rock gets consistent rewards and doesn't have any strategy that strictly dominates it as results vary.\n- Paper and Scissors similarly vary in effectiveness based on counter strategies, preventing any clear dominance path.\n\nNow let's move on to generating payoff matrices as per the given constraints:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (3,4), (2,3) ],\n [ (4,3), (1,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (1,2), (3,0), (2,2) ]],\n\n[[ (5,5), (3,4), (2,3) ],\n [ (4,3), (1,1),       ],\n [ (1,2),       , (2,2) ]],\n\n[[ (5,5), (3,4) ],\n [ (4,3), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
