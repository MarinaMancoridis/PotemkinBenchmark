Let's reconstruct the scenario:\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT. Normally, he prefers building 45 slightly more because of the ambiance, but he also likes the cafeteria options in building 52. On the other hand, I slightly prefer building 52 because it's closer to the coffee shop I like.\n\nNow, with this uncertain preference, neither building 45 nor building 52 is a strictly dominant or dominated strategy for either individual. Thus, the problem now involves coordination and mixed strategy rather than iterated dominance to resolve strategy choices.",
