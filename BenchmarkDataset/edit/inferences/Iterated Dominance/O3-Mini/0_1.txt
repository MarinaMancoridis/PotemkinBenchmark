    "inferences": "Iterated Dominance is a concept within game theory where strategies are eliminated iteratively based on the notion of strict dominance, where one strategy always results in a better payoff than another, regardless of what the other player does. To illustrate iterated dominance, consider the following game with two players: Player 1 (you) and Player 2 (the 200 customers in Central Square).\n\nLet's create a payoff matrix for both players, where the strategies for Player 1 (you) are to go to Harvard Square (HS) or Central Square (CS), and the strategies for Player 2 (the 200 customers) are to divide themselves among CS Life Alive and 'Other' restaurant. The payoff for Player 1 is based on the negative wait time (longer waits are worse, so larger negative numbers are worse), and the payoff for Player 2 is rather abstract, assuming that they prefer as many of them as possible to be free to go to their 'Other' restaurant, in total, without exceeding the set of 200, thus minimizing the number at CS Life Alive:\n\nInitially, we would set up a scenario where iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies can occur. Consider the following game involving simplified payoffs for illustration purposes:\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n- Player 1's strategies: Go to Harvard Square (HS), Go to Central Square (CS).\n- Player 2's strategies: Choose 0 to 200 customers to go to CS. We will represent only three possible distributions out of simplicity: '0 at CS', '100 at CS', and '200 at CS'. These are merely illustrations for iterated elimination.\n\nLet's define this by:\n1. Payoff is negative wait time for Player 1: -5 for HS, and -x/20 for Player 1 if x customers are at CS.\n2. For illustration, use a relatively simple value for negative utility of bunching at 'Other' rather than precise calculations.\n\nConstructing matrices:\n\nInitial Matrix: \n[[ (-5,0), (-5,-100), (-5,-200) ],\n [ (0,0), (-5,-100), (-10,-200) ]]\n\nIn the initial matrix, Player 1 would naturally start eliminating unlikely positive strategies in CS due to reducing advantages with increased x.\n\nAfter elimination Step 1: CS with 200 is strictly worse than CS with 0 and 100 for Player 1, eliminating CS with 200.\n[[ (-5,0), (-5,-100) ],\n [ (0,0), (-5,-100) ]]\n\nNow, you observe that CS with 100 would also be strictly or weakly dominated by CS with 0 and can hence be eliminated.\n\nAfter elimination Step 2: Final Matrix\n[[ (-5,0) ],\n [ (0,0) ]]\n\nThus, the final strategy would be to go to CS with 0 allowing by player consensus through iterated elimination.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-5,0), (-5,-100), (-5,-200) ],\n [ (0,0), (-5,-100), (-10,-200) ]],\n[[ (-5,0), (-5,-100) ],\n [ (0,0), (-5,-100) ]],\n[[ (-5,0) ],\n [ (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
