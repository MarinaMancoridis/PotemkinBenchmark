    "inferences": "To apply the concept of Iterated Dominance to the scenario, we need to structure it in a way where strictly dominated strategies can be iteratively eliminated. Consider the payoff matrix that represents the decision-making process of both firms, where each firm has two strategies: \"Advertise\" or \"Not Advertise\". The payoffs will be structured as economic outcomes (profits) considering the costs and revenues for both firms. \n\nFirst, construct a payoff matrix for both the firms based on their advertising costs and sales income:\n\n1. If both firms advertise: Each firm gets $30 million in sales minus their advertising cost of $35 million. Thus, both have a net payoff of -$5 million.\n2. If one firm advertises and the other does not: The advertising firm gets $50 million minus their $35 million cost, resulting in a payoff of $15 million. The non-advertising firm gets $0 million (sales income) with no costs, so its payoff is $0 million.\n3. If neither firm advertises: Each firm gets $10 million in sales and pays $0 in costs, so both have a payoff of $10 million.\n\nPayoff Matrix:\n- For both firms:\n  - Firm 1: Advertise, Not Advertise\n  - Firm 2: Advertise, Not Advertise\n\nLet's set up the initial matrix:\n```\nPayoff matrix before any elimination:\n\n                       Competitor\n                    Advertise     Not Advertise\nMy Firm   Advertise   (-5,-5)         (15,0)\n          Not Advertise (0,15)       (10,10)\n```\n\nApplying iterated strict dominance:\n- By column elimination for the competitor:\n  - \"Advertise\" by the competitor is strictly dominated by \"Not Advertise,\" as the competitor gets $10 when not advertising regardless of my firm's action.\n- Eliminate competitor's \"Advertise\" option:\n\n```\nAfter removing Competitor's dominated strategy:\n\n                    Competitor\n                    Not Advertise\nMy Firm   Advertise   (15,0)\n          Not Advertise (10,10)\n```\n\n- For my firm, \"Advertise\" is strictly dominated by \"Not Advertise\" since my firm gets a higher payoff ($10 million) when not advertising, regardless of the competitor's action.\n\n- Eliminate my firm's \"Advertise\" option:\n\n```\nMatrix after removing my firm's dominated strategy:\n\n                    Competitor\n                    Not Advertise\nMy Firm   Not Advertise (10,10)\n```\n\nThis remaining option indicates no strongly dominated strategies and aligns with both parties making optimal decisions. Both firms choosing \"Not Advertise\" with payoffs of (10,10) cannot be improved by unilaterally changing strategies.\n\nReflecting this through iterated dominance, here are the payoff matrices derived stepwise: \n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (-5,-5), (15,0) ],\n [ (0,15), (10,10) ]], [[ (15,0) ],\n [ (10,10) ]]",
