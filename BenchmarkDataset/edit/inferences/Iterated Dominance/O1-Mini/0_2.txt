For iterated dominance, there must be strictly dominated strategies, meaning options that are consistently worse than others regardless of what the other player does. \n\nAdjustment: Assume the brother is equally likely to go to either building if he is not influenced, and you too have no preference between the buildings unless directed by another factor. \n\nNow, in the new setup, neither you nor your brother has a strictly dominated strategy because both options (building 45 or building 52) are rationalizable based on unpredictability or indifference without external influence. This eliminates the iterated dominance aspect because you now need additional information to make a decision. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (1,2), (3,3) ],\n [ (3,0), (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,1), (3,2), (2,3) ]],\n[[ (2,1), (1,2), (3,3) ],\n [ (3,0), (2,2), (0,1) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
