Here's an example of how you might alter the payoff structure:\n\n1. If one person plays scissors and the other plays rock, then rock wins 0 points and scissors wins 2 points.\n2. If one person plays scissors and the other plays paper, then paper wins 1 point and scissors wins 2 points.\n3. If both players play scissors, then both players win 2 points.\n4. If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, the person playing rock wins 3 points, and the person playing paper wins 3 points.\n5. If both play rock, both win 4 points.\n6. If both play paper, both win 2 points.\n\nWith this modified payoff structure, there is no strategy that is strictly better or worse than the others across all potential ways the opponent might play. Therefore, none of the strategies is strictly dominated.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,4), (0,2), (3,3) ],\n [ (3,3), (2,2), (1,2) ],\n [ (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) ]]\n",
