    "inferences": "To turn this example into an instance of Iterated Dominance, we need to construct a scenario where both players (you and your brother) have strategies, and some of those strategies are strictly dominated. In this context, building choice is analogous to strategy selection. \n\nLet's say you both want to meet at the same building, so your joint payoff is highest when you choose the same building. We can assign numerical payoffs to these choices such that one choice strictly dominates the other for both you and your brother.\n\nConsider the following payoff matrices:\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n\n- Two players: You (Player 1) and Your Brother (Player 2).\n- Two strategies for each: Choose Building 45 (B45) or Choose Building 52 (B52).\n\nYou can create a payoff matrix where you and your brother get the highest payoff when you both choose the same building. Here's a set of matrices that represents this:\n\nInitial payoff matrix with strictly dominated strategies:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{{Player 1 / Player 2}} \n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n & \\text{B45} & \\text{B52} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{B45} & (2,2) & (0,0) \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{B52} & (0,0) & (1,1) \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIn this matrix:\n\n1. If both choose Building 45 (B45), payoffs are (2, 2).\n2. If one chooses Building 45 (B45) and the other chooses Building 52 (B52), payoffs are (0, 0).\n3. If both choose Building 52 (B52), payoffs are (1, 1).\n\n**Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies:**\n\n1. For Player 2 (Your Brother), choosing B52 is strictly dominated by choosing B45 because no matter what Player 1 chooses, Player 2 gets a higher payoff by choosing B45.\n2. For Player 1, choosing B52 is strictly dominated by choosing B45 for the same reason (higher payoffs irrespective of Player 2's choice).\n\nAfter eliminating the dominated strategies, we end up with the submatrix:\n\nFinal matrix after iterated dominance:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{{Player 1 / Player 2}} \n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n & \\text{B45} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{B45} & (2,2) \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, choosing Building 45 for both players is the strategy that survives iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. This leads to the solution: both players should head to Building 45. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,0) ], [ (0,0), (1,1) ]], [[ (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
