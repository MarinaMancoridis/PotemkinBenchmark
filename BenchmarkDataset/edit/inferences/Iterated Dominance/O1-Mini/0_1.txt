    "inferences": "To modify your scenario into a game theory problem that can be analyzed using iterated dominance, let's introduce a second player and structure the decision as a strategic game with payoff matrices. Consider two players, Player 1 (you) and Player 2 (another potential customer), each choosing independently between the Harvard Square cafe and the Central Square cafe. The payoffs will depend on the wait times at each location.\n\nAssume Player 2 faces the same decision with independent payoffs based on the wait time at each cafe. Suppose that the payoff for each player is inversely related to their wait time (e.g., payoff = 100 - wait time). Let's start with an initial matrix, apply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, and then ensure no strictly dominated strategies remain in the final matrix for either player.\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix (where Player 1 chooses rows and Player 2 chooses columns, based on hypothetical wait times):\n\n1. If Player 1 goes to Harvard (5 min wait) and Player 2 goes to Harvard (5 min wait):\n   - Payoffs: (100-5, 100-5) = (95, 95)\n   \n2. If Player 1 goes to Harvard and Player 2 goes to Central (e.g., 10 min wait):\n   - Payoffs: (95, 100-10) = (95, 90)\n\n3. If Player 1 goes to Central (10 min wait) and Player 2 goes to Harvard:\n   - Payoffs: (100-10, 95) = (90, 95)\n\n4. If both go to Central (20 min wait due to mutual crowding):\n   - Payoffs: (100-20, 100-20) = (80, 80)\n\nInitial payoff matrix:\n```\n[ [(95, 95), (95, 90)],\n  [(90, 95), (80, 80)] ]\n```\n\nWe will now apply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\n1. Check if there are any strictly dominated strategies for Player 1 and Player 2 and eliminate them if possible.\n\nThis process continues until no strictly dominated strategies remain for either player.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (95, 95), (95, 90) ],\n [ (90, 95), (80, 80) ]],\n[[ (95, 95), (95, 90) ],\n [ (90, 95), (80, 80) ]],\n[[ (95, 95), (95, 90) ],\n [ (90, 95), (80, 80) ]]",
