In the original example, advertising is strictly dominated for both firms because the costs outweigh the benefits.\n\nChange advertising costs for both firms so that one firm has an incentive when the other firm is not advertising, and vice versa. Here's the modified payoff:\n\n|               | Competitor Advertises | Competitor Doesn't Advertise |\n|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|\n| My firm Advertises | (-5, -30)               | (15, 0)                    |\n| My firm Doesn't Advertise | (30, -10)             | (10, 10)                  |\n\nIn this version, my firm will have different incentives depending on competitor's actions, with no strictly dominated strategy due to modified advertising costs:\n\n- If both advertise, my firm will lose $5 million (owing to increased cost reduction).\n- If my firm alone advertises, the payoff is $15 million.\n- If the competitor alone advertises, it loses $10 million (due to high advertising cost).\n- If nobody advertises, both firms earn $10 million.\n\nNow, neither strategy is strictly dominated for either player, as each has situations where it\u2019s profitable depending on the other firm\u2019s action.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (-5,-30), (15,0), (15,0) ],\n [ (30,-10), (10,10), (10,10) ],\n [ (30,-10), (10,10), (10,10) ]]",
