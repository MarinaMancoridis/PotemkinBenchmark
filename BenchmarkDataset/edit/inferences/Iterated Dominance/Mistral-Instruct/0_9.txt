The game consists of a payoff matrix for each round of elimination of strictly dominated strategies. The final matrix represents the game with no strictly dominated strategies.\n\nHere are the payoff matrices for each round:\n\n[[[ (0, 10), (30, 30), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (0, 0), (50, 0) ],\n [ (0, 10), (0, 0), (0, 10) ]],\n\n[[[ (0, 10), (30, 30), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (35, 0), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 10), (0, 0), (0, 10) ]],\n\n[[[ (0, 10), (30, 30), (0, 0) ],\n [ (35, 0), (0, 0), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 10), (0, 0), (0, 10) ]],\n\n[[[ (0, 10), (30, 30), (0, 0) ],\n [ (35, 35), (0, 0), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 10), (0, 0), (0, 10) ]]\n]\n\nIn the first matrix, if both firms choose not to advertise, they both get $10 million dollars in sales. If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm gets $50 million in sales, while the non-advertising firm gets no sales. If both firms advertise, they both get $30 million dollars in sales. For both firms, cereal costs no money to produce, and advertising costs $35 million.\n\nIn the second matrix, when the first firm eliminates the strategy of not advertising when the competitor does not, the new matrix is formed. This strategy is strictly dominated by advertising for the first firm, as advertising when the competitor does not results in a higher payoff ($50 million) compared to not advertising ($10 million).\n\nIn the third matrix, when the competitor firm eliminates the strategy of not advertising when the first firm does not, the new matrix is formed. This strategy is strictly dominated by not advertising for the competitor firm, as not advertising when the first firm advertises results in a higher payoff ($10 million) compared to advertising ($0 million).\n\nIn the fourth matrix, when the first firm eliminates the strategy of advertising when the competitor does not, the new matrix is formed. This strategy is strictly dominated by not advertising for the first firm, as not advertising when the competitor does not advertise results in a higher payoff ($10 million) compared to advertising ($35 million).\n\nIn the final matrix, both firms have no strictly dominated strategies. The equilibrium strategies are for both firms to not advertise, resulting in a payoff of $10 million dollars for each firm. However, this outcome is not Pareto optimal, as both firms could achieve a higher payoff by advertising when the other firm does not. This game demonstrates the concept of iterated dominance, where strategies are eliminated based on their dominance over other strategies, leading to the final equilibrium.",
