    "inferences": "Here's the payoff matrices for this example that represent the iterated dominance concept:\n\n[[ (0,5), (x, x/2) ],\n [ (200-x, 0), (200, 0) ]]\n\n[[ (0,5), (x, (x-5)/2) ],\n [ (200-x, 0), (200, 0) ]]\n\n[[ (0,5), (x, (x-5)/2) ],\n [ (200-x, 0), (200-(200-x)), 0 ]]\n\n[[ (0,5), (x, (x-5)/2) ],\n [ (x, 0), (200-x, 0) ]]\n\nIn the first matrix, Player 1 (You) can see that if you choose the Central Square Life Alive cafe when there are x customers, you get a payoff of x/2, but if you choose the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe, you get a payoff of 5. Since 5 is greater than x/2 for any value of x, choosing the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe is not dominated by choosing the Central Square Life Alive cafe.\n\nIn the second matrix, Player 1 can see that if you choose the Central Square Life Alive cafe when there are x customers, you get a payoff of (x-5)/2, but if you choose the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe, you still get a payoff of 5. Since 5 is greater than (x-5)/2 for any value of x, choosing the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe is still not dominated by choosing the Central Square Life Alive cafe.\n\nIn the third matrix, Player 1 can see that if you choose the Central Square Life Alive cafe when there are x customers, you get a payoff of (x-5)/2, but if you choose the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe, you still get a payoff of 5. However, if you choose the Central Square Life Alive cafe and there are no other customers (x=0), you get a payoff of 200, which is greater than the payoff of 5 from choosing the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe. But since there are always 200 customers in Central Square, this case is not relevant. Therefore, choosing the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe is still not dominated by choosing the Central Square Life Alive cafe.\n\nIn the fourth matrix, Player 1 can see that if you choose the Central Square Life Alive cafe when there are x customers, you get a payoff of x, but if you choose the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe, you still get a payoff of 5. Since 5 is less than x for any value of x greater than 5, choosing the Central Square Life Alive cafe is not dominated by choosing the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe when there are more than 5 customers. However, if there are 5 or fewer customers, choosing the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe is not dominated by choosing the Central Square Life Alive cafe.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix has no strictly dominated strategies, and the choice depends on the number of customers in the Central Square Life Alive cafe. If there are 5 or fewer customers, choose the Harvard Square Life Alive cafe. If there are more than 5 customers, choose the Central Square Life Alive cafe.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,5), (x, (x-5)/2) ],\n [ (x, 0), (200-x, 0) ]]",
