She told me that I shouldn\u2019t have to try and that it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d to just ask. She feels like I\u2019m inconsiderate.\n\nI don\u2019t get it\u2026 any thoughts? Does she deserve an apology?\n\nUPDAT: We have good communication and a healthy relationship. It just seems that she wants me to ask about specifics the very first moment I see her almost as a reaction.",

    "inferences": "One possible line of dialogue that could make the \"Demanding Bias\" more obvious is:  \n\n*\"Why can't you just ask me how it was without me having to remind you?\"*  \n\nThis reflects the expectation that the other person should automatically meet a specific demand without explicit communication or consideration of their natural tendencies."
