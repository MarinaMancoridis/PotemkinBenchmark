    "example": "I live with my parents and recently we moved houses. We now have a dishwasher. We also own two cats, who both use their litterbox. To scoop the poo out, we have a kind of shovel. Obviously that shovel gets dirty and we need to clean it. Normally, we would clean it seperate from the dishes since we had to wash everything ourselves anyways. However my parents have now decided to just throw it in the dishwasher along with the dishes already in there. I confronted my mom about this and argued that for example, we wouldn't put a dirty toilet brush in there. She agreed, but a couple of days later I found it in the dishwasher again. My dad was home at the time and so I argued the same thing, but he says the dishwasher is made to clean and that it doesn't matter. Am I right? Is it gross? Or is a dishwasher strong enough to clean those bacteria?",

    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a line of dialogue that makes the Sunk Cost Fallacy obvious in the given text. Let me first understand the scenario. The family moved, got a dishwasher, and now they're putting the cat litter shovel in the dishwasher. The person argues it's gross, but the parents keep doing it. The dad says the dishwasher is made to clean, so it's fine.\n\nThe Sunk Cost Fallacy is when you continue a behavior because of previously invested resources (time, money, effort) even if it's not the best decision. How does that apply here? Maybe the parents are using the dishwasher because they already have it (sunk cost) and don't want to \"waste\" not using it, even if it's unhygienic. But wait, the original text doesn't mention anything about past investments. So the dialogue needs to hint at that.\n\nThe parents might be justifying using the dishwasher because they have it now, so they feel they need to use it for everything to get their money's worth. The line should show that they're continuing to use the dishwasher for the shovel because they've already invested in having it, not because it's the right choice.\n\nPossible dialogue from the parents: \"We paid for this dishwasher, so we might as well use it for everything, even if it's a bit gross.\" That ties the continued use (even if gross) to the prior investment (paying for the dishwasher), which is the sunk cost fallacy.\n</think>\n\n\"We\u2019ve already run the dishwasher twice this week for the shovel\u2014might as well keep doing it now.\""
