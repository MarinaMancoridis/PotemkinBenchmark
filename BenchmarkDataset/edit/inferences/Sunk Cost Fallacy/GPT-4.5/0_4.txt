So I ask, \"Are they bulky? Like the one I already have?\" (My thought process was: If they are smaller/lighter, then yes I'll take one. If not, I want to be considerate of his money and not have him buy me something I already have.)\n\nSuddenly I can tell he's agitated. I tell him, \"Hey, I'm not trying to be a bitch, I'm ju--\" Him interrupting me:\"Yea but you are though\"\n\nLook,I'm from MN (arguably th3 nicest state) and he's from NJ (arguably the rudest/most aggressive). He's called me fragile and says I overreact. To me, this is not how adults in a healthy relationship speak to one another. Did he call me a bitch directly? No, he used what I said as a way to imply it.\n\nAlso, I don't appreciate being attacked when my intention is to be considerate of him/his money\n\nFrom my perspective he's being toxic when he impulsively take his agitation out on me like this.
