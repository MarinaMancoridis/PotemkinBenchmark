    "example": "My (24F) partner (29M) is going to be having his PhD defense soon, and told me he will be including a photo of his ex at the end in his personal acknowledgements. They did not split on amicable terms, (hopefully) have not spoken in 2 years, and she will not be attending. He is doing this, in his words, out of being \"honor bound.\" She did not have a role in the work itself, so not a credit for the writing/experiments. I feel pretty uncomfortable. I recognize he can acknowledge those who were part of his journey, but I just had my Master's defense and not even for a second considered putting my ex in mine. Like, it would be disrespectful to my partner. I feel like I'm going to be sick going to his defense and seeing this. I don't want to be childish about this but I can't tell if I have a right to feeling disrespected here.\n\n On this note, we've had an ongoing conversation in our relationship (almost 2 years) about him bringing up exes. We'll be out on a date and he'll say \"oh I went on a karaoke date with this lady here.\" Similarly, last summer he went to the club with a different ex and some friends (it wasn't a long relationship and she has a partner now), and she danced all up on him. He pushed her away, but proceeded to trickle truth it to me (it took half a year to get all the details), and he is still trying to keep her in his life because he doesn't want to \"eff up the vibes.\" She lives in another state and they see each other maybe once a year.\n\n All being said, I can't tell if him refusing to distance his mind and self from exes is something I have a right to be upset over. The only time my exes come up is usually in a conversation about something that's hurt me in the past, etc. I took down all my old photos of exes (my partner hasn't, and you can see a whole gallery on his Facebook of him hugging and kissing her), threw away old letters, etc. Is this something I can be firm on? I don't want to be a controlling girlfriend but also this honestly hurts me.",
