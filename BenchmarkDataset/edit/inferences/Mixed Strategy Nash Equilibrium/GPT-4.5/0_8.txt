    "inferences": "To alter this example and ensure it is not an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we should aim to create a payoff matrix where a dominant strategy exists for both players.\n\nCurrently:\n- Manu's strategies: \"Hiking\" vs. \"Movie Night\"\n- Tom's strategies: \"Beach Day\" vs. \"Board Games\"\n\nWe need to construct a payoff matrix with values that lead to pure strategies being chosen due to dominance. Here, a dominant strategy would mean one strategy always yields a better (or at least equal) payoff for a player regardless of their opponent's choice.\n\n### Create a new payoff matrix with dominated strategies\n\n- Assign high positive payoffs to one clear pair of strategies and low payoffs for others, ensuring no mixed strategy is possible.\n\nExample:\n- If Manu goes Hiking and Tom chooses Beach Day, they both earn 2 points.\n- If Manu goes Hiking and Tom chooses Board Games, Manu gets 1 point and Tom earns 2 points.\n- If Manu chooses Movie Night and Tom picks Beach Day, Manu earns 3 points and Tom gets 1 point.\n- If Manu chooses Movie Night and Tom chooses Board Games, both Manu and Tom earn 0 points.\n\nManu's payoffs (first number in each pair):\n- Hiking: 2 (with Beach Day) / 1 (with Board Games)\n- Movie Night: 3 (with Beach Day) / 0 (with Board Games)\n\nTom's payoffs (second number in each pair):\n- Beach Day: 2 (with Hiking) / 1 (with Movie Night)\n- Board Games: 2 (with Hiking) / 0 (with Movie Night)\n\n**The Dominant Strategy Explanation:**\n- Manu would prefer Movie Night as it has a higher potential payoff (3 or 0 compared to 2 or 1) regardless of Tom's choice, hence no need for mixed strategy.\n- Tom prefers Board Games due to consistent better outcomes (2 or 0 compared to 2 or 1).\n\nThe strategy pair (Movie Night, Board Games) has become a dominant equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (2,2), (1,2) ],\n [ (3,1), (0,0) ]]",
