    "inferences": "To alter the example such that it is no longer an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to ensure that at least one of the players has a strict preference over their strategies. \n\nOne way to change the game is to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy becomes strictly dominant for at least one player. This would remove the necessity for mixing strategies, as the player would always get a higher payoff by following their dominant strategy.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs as follows:\n- If both players choose their non-preferred (e.g., Uptempo and Lyrical), the payoff becomes neutral for both, and no thrill or disappointment is registered (0, 0).\n- If both choose their preferred (e.g., Uptempo and Rhythmic), it results in a neutral outcome for Paul and a high positive for Martha (2, 0).\n- The other combinations provide a slight advantage to one and a minor disadvantage to the other.\n\nBy setting these specific payoffs, we can create a scenario where there might not be a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0, 0), (-1, 1) ],\n [ (2, 0), (1, -1) ]]",
