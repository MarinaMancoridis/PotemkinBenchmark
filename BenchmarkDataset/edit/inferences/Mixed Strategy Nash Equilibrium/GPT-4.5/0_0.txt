    "inferences": "To alter the example so it does not represent a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoff matrix such that mixed strategies (probabilities) do not exist as an equilibrium solution.\n\nIn the original scenario, neither roommate has a preference for the outcome, which leads to them randomly mixing between the options (hence a mixed strategy equilibrium). To remove the possibility of a mixed strategy equilibrium, we should change the payoff matrix such that one strategy strictly dominates the others for one of the players, eliminating the need for mixing strategies.\n\nFor instance, let's assign payoffs such that one strategy dominates for one or both players:\n\nAssign payoffs such that:\n- Roommate 1 strongly prefers Urban (U) over Dreamy (D) regardless of Roommate 2's choice.\n- Roommate 2 strongly prefers Lush (L) over Rustic (R) regardless of Roommate 1's choice.\n\nBy making one strategy better for each player, you effectively force them into choosing their strictly dominant strategies and invalidate the mixed strategy setting.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (3,1) ],\n [ (0,2), (0,1) ]]\n",
