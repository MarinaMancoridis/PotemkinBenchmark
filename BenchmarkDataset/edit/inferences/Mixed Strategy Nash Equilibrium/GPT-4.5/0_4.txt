    "inferences": "To change the example to not have a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we would need to alter the payoffs such that there is a dominant strategy for each player. This can be achieved by adjusting the incentives such that the best response for each player consistently points to a specific strategy regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nWe can modify the payoffs so that one strategy becomes the strictly better choice for both players:\n\n1. Both players prefer Pepperoni over the other choices, resulting in a positive payoff when they both choose it. \n2. The other combinations lead to negative or zero payoffs or are clearly less beneficial.\n\nLet's construct a new payoff matrix to achieve this:\n\nFred\\Neville's Payoffs:\n- If both choose Pepperoni: +(2,2) as they agree and are happy.\n- If Fred chooses Pepperoni but Neville chooses something else: Penalty for Fred (-1) and less reward for Neville (0).\n- If Neville chooses Pepperoni but Fred chooses something else: Penalty for Neville (-1) and less reward for Fred (0).\n- If neither chooses Pepperoni: Small payoff, or penalty, less than agreeing on Pepperoni.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,-1), (-1,0) ],\n [ (-1,0), (1,1), (0,-1) ],\n [ (0,-1), (-1,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
