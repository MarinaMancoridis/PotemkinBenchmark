The rows represent Fred's strategies, and the columns represent Neville's strategies. The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs for each player when the corresponding strategies are chosen.\n\nIn this case, the given probabilities for the mixed strategies create a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE). To verify this, we can calculate the expected payoffs for both players:\n\n1. Fred's expected payoff when choosing pepperoni:\n   (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * (-1)) + (1/3 * 1) = 0\n\n2. Fred's expected payoff when choosing mushrooms:\n   (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * (-1)) = 0\n\n3. Fred's expected payoff when choosing pineapple:\n   (1/3 * (-1)) + (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * 0) = 0\n\nSince Fred's expected payoff is the same for all strategies, Fred has no incentive to deviate from his mixed strategy.\n\n4. Neville's expected payoff when choosing pepperoni:\n   (1/2 * 0) + (1/2 * 1) = 0.5\n\n5. Neville's expected payoff when choosing mushrooms:\n   (1/2 * (-1)) + (1/2 * 0) = -0.5\n\nSince Neville's expected payoff is not the same for both strategies, we need to check if Neville's best response is still a mixed strategy.\n\n6. Neville's best response when choosing pepperoni:\n   (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * (-1)) = 0\n\n7. Neville's best response when choosing mushrooms:\n   (1/3 * (-1)) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 1) = 0\n\nSince Neville's best response is still 0, Neville has no incentive to deviate from his mixed strategy.\n\nTherefore, the given probabilities for the mixed strategies create a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium for the Pizza Topping Wars game.",
