The rows represent Joe's strategies (U, D), and the columns represent Ben's strategies (L, R). The numbers in the matrix represent the payoffs for Joe (rows) and Ben (columns). The diagonal entries are empty because there are no payoffs when both players choose the same strategy.\n\nIn this case, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium occurs when both Joe and Ben have a 50% chance of choosing each of their strategies. This means that, on average, Joe will buy Utility Gear (U) and Durable Gear (D) with equal probability, and Ben will buy Lightweight Items (L) and Rugged Items (R) with equal probability.\n\nIn the given payoff matrix, if both players choose a mixed strategy with equal probabilities, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their strategy, as their payoffs will remain the same. This satisfies the conditions for a Nash equilibrium. However, since all other combinations of strategies result in zero payoffs, the only Nash equilibrium in this game is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.",
