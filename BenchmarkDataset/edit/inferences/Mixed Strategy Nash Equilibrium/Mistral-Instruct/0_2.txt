The game is now about two artists deciding on the genre of their next song: Pop or Rock.\n\n[[ (2,1), (0,3) ],\n [ (3,0), (1,2) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, Player 1 (Artist A) chooses between Pop or Rock, and Player 2 (Artist B) chooses between Pop or Rock as well. The numbers represent the payoffs for each player. For example, if both artists choose Pop, Artist A gets 2 points and Artist B gets 1 point. If both artists choose Rock, Artist A gets 3 points and Artist B gets 0 points. The game does not have a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium because there is a pure strategy that dominates the other strategies.",
