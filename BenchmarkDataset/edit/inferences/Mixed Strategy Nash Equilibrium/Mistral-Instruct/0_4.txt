The other cases are symmetrical.\n\nThe given mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is not applicable to this game. The game has a dominant strategy for each player, which is to choose the topping that they prefer the most, as the payoff is always better when both players choose different toppings. In a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their strategy given the other player's strategy. In this case, if both players choose their preferred toppings, neither has an incentive to deviate.",
