    "inferences": "To modify the example so that it fits a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, the strategies should be adjusted so that neither player has a pure strategy equilibrium, implying that each player's strategies effectively counterbalance the other. Therefore, in the game, both players should be indifferent among their strategies, leading them to randomize.\n\nFor instance, let's redefine the payoffs as follows: \n\n- If Joe chooses Utility Gear (U) and Ben chooses Lightweight Items (L), Joe gets a payoff of 2 and Ben gets a payoff of 1.\n- If Joe chooses Utility Gear (U) and Ben chooses Rugged Items (R), Joe gets a payoff of 0 and Ben gets a payoff of 2.\n- If Joe chooses Durable Gear (D) and Ben chooses Lightweight Items (L), Joe gets a payoff of 3 and Ben gets a payoff of 0.\n- If Joe chooses Durable Gear (D) and Ben chooses Rugged Items (R), Joe gets a payoff of 1 and Ben gets a payoff of 1.\n\nNow, let's represent this in a payoff matrix. The goal is to have distribution over strategy choices such that players are indifferent among their strategies:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (3,0), (1,1) ]]\n",
