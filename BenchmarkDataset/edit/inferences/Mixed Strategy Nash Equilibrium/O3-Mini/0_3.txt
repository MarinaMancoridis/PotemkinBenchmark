The payoff matrix we create should reflect situations in which the players are indifferent among their strategies given the mixed strategy of their opponent.\n\nLet's define a new payoff structure that satisfies the criteria for a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium without providing a pure strategy advantage for either player.\n\nFor our matrix:\n- Martha's pure strategies: Uptempo or Downbeat\n- Paul's pure strategies: Lyrical or Rhythmic\n\nWe seek a payoff matrix with rational players where their best response involves mixing strategies rather than committing to one.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (1,4) ],\n [ (2,3), (4,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
