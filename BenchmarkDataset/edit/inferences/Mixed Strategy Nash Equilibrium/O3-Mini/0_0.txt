In this case, introduce payoffs that ensure one strategy is always better for each player, regardless of the other\u2019s decision. \n\nFor example, we can adjust the utility by associating specific payoffs to each outcome, ensuring a dominant strategy emerges.\n\n<Game adjustment>\nPayoffs:\n- If both choose Urban and Lush: (1, 1)\n- If both choose Urban and Rustic: (0, 2)\n- If both choose Dreamy and Lush: (2, 0)\n- If both choose Dreamy and Rustic: (3, 3)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (2,0), (3,3) ]]\n",
