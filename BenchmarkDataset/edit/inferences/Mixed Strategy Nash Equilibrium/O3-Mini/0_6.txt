    "inferences": "To make the scenario not an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to alter the payoffs in such a way that there's a clear dominant strategy for at least one player. This can be done by modifying the payoffs so that one player's best response doesn't depend on the probabilities of the other player's strategies.\n\nLet's change the payoffs for some of the outcomes:\n\n1. If Kevin chooses chips and Claire chooses chocolate, both get a mild stomach ache (-2 points to each).\n2. If Kevin chooses chips and Claire chooses candy, both Kevin and Claire feel mildly dissatisfied (-1 point to each).\n3. If Kevin chooses popcorn and Claire chooses chocolate, Claire feels neutral, but Kevin is satisfied with his choice (+2 points for Kevin and +0 for Claire).\n4. If Kevin chooses popcorn and Claire chooses candy, Kevin feels delighted with his snack (+3 points), and Claire feels neutral (+0).\n\nWith this new setup:\n\n- Kevin's best strategy becomes choosing popcorn regardless of what Claire does, as his payoffs are better when choosing popcorn in both outcomes (2 or 3 points versus negative or zero).\n- Claire no longer influences the outcome in a way that changes her optimal strategy based on probabilities.\n\nThis adjustment results in the following payoff matrix, which shows a clear dominant strategy for Kevin and thus removes the conditions needed for a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-2,-2), (-1,-1) ],\n [ (2,0), (3,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
