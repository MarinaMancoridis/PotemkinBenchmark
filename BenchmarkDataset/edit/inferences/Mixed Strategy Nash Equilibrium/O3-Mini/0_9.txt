    "inferences": "In order to establish a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player must be indifferent between their pure strategies when taking the mixed strategy probabilities of the other player's actions into account. The payoffs must also be adjusted to non-negative integers to form a valid game theory model. Below is an example that could serve as a replacement while meeting the required conditions:\n\nConsider the following payoff adjustments:\n\n1. If Manu chooses to not hike, and Tom chooses not the beach day, it rains and neither has fun resulting in a payoff of (0, 0).\n2. If Manu selects not hiking and Tom opts for not board games, Manu gets bored (- translated to 0 due to non-negative requirement), but Tom is indifferent with a payoff of (0, 1).\n3. If Manu doesn't pick a movie night and Tom doesn't go to the beach, Manu ends up dissatisfied resulting in a payoff of (1, 0).\n4. If Manu avoids a movie night and Tom avoids board games, they both enjoy moderately resulting in a payoff of (1, 1).\n\nLet's verify:\n\nFor Manu:\n- If Tom chooses not beach day with 1/3 probability and not board games with 2/3:\n  - The expected payoff for Manu not hiking = \\( \\frac{1}{3} * 0 + \\frac{2}{3} * 0 = 0 \\)\n  - The expected payoff for Manu not watching a movie = \\( \\frac{1}{3} * 1 + \\frac{2}{3} * 1 = 1 \\)\n\nFor Tom:\n- If Manu chooses not hiking with 1/3 probability and not movie night with 2/3:\n  - The expected payoff for Tom not beach day = \\( \\frac{1}{3} * 0 + \\frac{2}{3} * 0 = 0 \\)\n  - The expected payoff for Tom not board games = \\( \\frac{1}{3} * 1 + \\frac{2}{3} * 1 = 1 \\)\n\nBoth players are indifferent between their choices. Thus, these conditions satisfy a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0, 0), (0, 1) ],\n [ (1, 0), (1, 1) ]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\nHere, each cell represents a scenario where the first value represents Player 1's (Manu's) payoff and the second value represents Player 2's (Tom's) payoff.",
