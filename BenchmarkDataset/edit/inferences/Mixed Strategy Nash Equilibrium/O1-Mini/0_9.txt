    "inferences": "To modify the example to be an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we must adjust the payoffs such that neither player has a dominant pure strategy. Instead, the players should be indifferent between their strategies when the opponent is playing a mixed strategy.\n\nLet's modify the payoff so that each player has an incentive to randomize over their strategies.\n\nAssume the strategies are:\n\n- Manu: Not Hiking (H), Not Movie Night (M)\n- Tom: Not Beach Day (B), Not Board Games (G)\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs:\n\n1. If Manu chooses Not Hiking and Tom chooses Not Beach Day, both feel like they've wasted a weekend. (1,1)\n2. If Manu chooses Not Hiking and Tom chooses Not Board Games, Manu feels Tom is a bit dull, but not too much. (0,2)\n3. If Manu chooses Not Movie Night and Tom chooses Not Beach Day, Manu enjoys a restful evening, except it could have been better. (2,0)\n4. If Manu chooses Not Movie Night and Tom chooses Not Board Games, they have moderately dull fun. (1,1)\n\nIn this setup, if both players randomize their strategies with specific probabilities, their expected payoffs can make them indifferent between their options, hence meeting the condition for Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (1,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (2,0), (1,1) ]]",
