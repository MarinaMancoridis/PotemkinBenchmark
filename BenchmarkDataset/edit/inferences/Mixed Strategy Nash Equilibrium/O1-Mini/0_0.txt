    "inferences": "To make the scenario not an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the utilities so that there's no reason for the players to randomize their strategies. For it to be a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, each player should be indifferent to their strategy given the mixed strategy of the other player. We'll create a payoff matrix where one or more strategies are strictly better, meaning players will not be indifferent.\n\nLet's consider the following payoff matrix modifications:\n\n- Assign distinct positive payoffs that create a dominant strategy for one or both players.\n- Ensure that each player has a clear best response, eliminating indifference.\n\nBy doing this, we eliminate the possibility for each player to randomize their strategies in equilibrium since one strategy will always be better. Here's a modified game representation:\n\nInstead of assigning equal utilities, we'll provide varying payoffs to demonstrate preferences:\n\nRoommate 1 (Player 1) prefers Urban (U) if Roommate 2 chooses Rustic (R), and prefers Dreamy (D) if Roommate 2 chooses Lush (L). Roommate 2 prefers Lush (L) when compared to Rustic (R), regardless of the theme chosen by Roommate 1. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (1,4) ],\n [ (2,3), (4,1) ]]\n",
