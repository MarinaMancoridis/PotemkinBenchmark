    "inferences": "To change the \"Pizza Topping Wars\" game so that it does not exhibit a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs in such a way that there exists a dominant strategy for each player. When a game has a dominant strategy for both players, mixed strategy equilibria are unlikely or not necessary, as at least one pure strategy will be more favorable regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nTo do this, let's modify the payoffs so that one strategy strictly dominates the others for each player.\n\nFor example, let's make the following modifications:\n\n1. Fred and Neville both prefer Pepperoni overwhelmingly.\n2. When choosing the same action that is not Pepperoni, they receive a small negative payoff.\n3. When choosing differing actions, they overwhelmingly prefer their chosen action if Fred chooses Pepperoni and Neville chooses Mushrooms, or vice versa.\n\nWith these modified conditions, the payoff structure might appear as follows:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (-2,3), (1,-1) ],\n [ (3,-2), (-1,-1), (2,-2) ],\n [ (-1,1), (2,-2), (-2,-2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
