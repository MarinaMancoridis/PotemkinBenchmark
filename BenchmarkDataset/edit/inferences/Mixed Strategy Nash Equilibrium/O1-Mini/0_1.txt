    "inferences": "To make the example an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to create a scenario where players are indifferent between their strategy options due to the calculated mixed strategies of their opponent.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that each player has a mixed strategy that makes them indifferent to choosing between their options. For this example, both Joe and Ben will find their optimal strategy by mixing between their options with some probability such that neither can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs:\n\n- Joe's payoffs for U/L, U/R, D/L, and D/R are (3,2), (1,2), (2,1), and (0,0) respectively.\n- Ben's payoffs for U/L, U/R, D/L, and D/R are (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), and (0,0) respectively.\n\nIn this setup, by ensuring that Joe and Ben randomize between their strategies, they make each other indifferent, achieving a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\nThe payoff matrix will look as follows:\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (1,2) ],\n [ (2,1), (0,0) ]]\n",
