    "inferences": "To make this scenario no longer an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoff matrix such that there is at least one pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. In a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, at least one strategy is always optimal given the opponent's strategy.\n\nLet's start by defining the payoff matrix from the original problem:\n\n[[ (1,-1), (-1,1) ], \n [ (-1,1), (1,-1) ]]\n\nThis matrix represents a situation where neither player has a dominant strategy, and any optimal strategy involves mixing between choices. \n\nTo ensure that it doesn't result in a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium, we can alter the entries such that one of them becomes a strictly higher payoff for both players. For example, adjusting (A1, B1) to make it more appealing to both players compared to others:\n\n[[ (2,2), (-1,1) ], \n [ (-1,1), (1,-1) ]]\n\nNow, let's check:\n\n1. If both players choose the top-left option, (2,2), neither has an incentive to deviate since they would get less payoff by changing strategy (given the other's choice).\n\nIn this adjusted scenario, the top-left option serves as a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, as both Martha and Paul receive the highest payoff when jointly opting for \"Uptempo\" and \"Lyrical\" respectively, reducing the mixed strategy incentive.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (-1,1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
