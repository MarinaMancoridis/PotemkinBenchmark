    "inferences": "A Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium occurs when players randomize over possible strategies to keep each other indifferent between their options. In the game provided, we observe negative payoffs, which suggest penalties rather than incentives for the players' choices. To remove the potential mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can adjust the scenario so that some outcomes are dominated by others, ensuring there would be no incentive to randomize their strategies.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs such that one strategy for each player clearly dominates the other:\n\n1. If Kevin chooses chips and Claire chooses chocolate, both get a mild pleasure (+2 points to each).\n2. If Kevin chooses chips and Claire chooses candy, Kevin enjoys a slight edge from the choice (+3 points), and Claire enjoys it too (+3 points).\n3. If Kevin chooses popcorn and Claire chooses chocolate, Kevin gets a high satisfaction (+5 points), and Claire is left neutral (+0 points).\n4. If Kevin chooses popcorn and Claire chooses candy, both feel content (+1 points to each).\n\nNow, under these conditions, if we were to evaluate potential equilibria, we would find that Claire would always prefer candy due to the uniformly higher payoff compared to chocolate. Similarly, Kevin would prefer chips. Thus, their strategies become predictable and dominated \u2014 with both leaning towards a particular option rather than employing a randomized mixed strategy.\n\nThe new payoff matrix should clearly mark scenarios where specific strategies are strictly better, eliminating a scenario that supports a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (3,3) ],\n [ (5,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
