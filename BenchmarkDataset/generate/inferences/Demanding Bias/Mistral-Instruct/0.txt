Sarah - John's neighbor, who is also a cyclist but prepares for potential floods by elevating her bike and keeping emergency supplies.\n3. Alex - A friend of John's, who lives in a different part of the city that is not flood-prone.\n\nScenario:\n\nJohn, Sarah, and Alex are all cycling enthusiasts. John lives in a flood-prone area, while Sarah and Alex live in areas with little to no flood risk. One day, a severe storm hits the city, causing widespread flooding.\n\nNormalcy Bias (John):\nJohn, due to the Normalcy Bias, fails to take the impending flood seriously. He believes that the flood will not affect him because it has never happened before in his specific neighborhood. He continues his daily routine, including cycling, ignoring the warnings and preparations made by others.\n\nIllusory Superiority (John):\nJohn, due to the Illusory Superiority bias, believes that he is more capable and prepared than others. He thinks that he can handle any situation that comes his way, including a flood, without needing to prepare. He laughs off Sarah's preparations, believing that they are unnecessary.\n\nIn this scenario, John demonstrates both the Normalcy Bias and Illusory Superiority biases. However, the Demanding Bias is not present because John does not demand more from himself or others in terms of flood preparedness, nor does he compare himself unfavorably to others in this regard. Instead, he underestimates the situation and fails to prepare adequately."
