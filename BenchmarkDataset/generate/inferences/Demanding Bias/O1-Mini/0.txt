One weekend, the group decides to take on a project of building a bookshelf from a popular DIY kit. \n\n**Characters**:\n1. Alex, an enthusiastic DIYer.\n2. Jamie, another member of the group, but less experienced.\n\n**Illusory Superiority**:\nAlex has completed a few projects before and often feels that their DIY skills are above average compared to others in the group. As they start working on the bookshelf, Alex believes they won't need to follow the instructions meticulously, thinking they understand the assembly better than most people. Even when others struggle and compare their progress, Alex assumes their approach is more efficient and superior, despite their bookshelf not looking significantly better than Jamie's.\n\n**IKEA Effect**:\nAfter hours of assembling the bookshelf, Alex finally completes it. Despite some visible imperfections and minor misalignments, Alex feels a strong sense of pride and accomplishment. This is because they invested time and effort into building it themselves. Alex views their self-assembled bookshelf as not only functional but also superior in value to any other ready-made bookshelf they could purchase from a store, simply because of the personal effort involved.\n\n**Exclusion of the Pseudocertainty Effect**:\nAt no point in this scenario does Alex's decision-making rely on framing a sequence of choices to create an illusion of certainty. Their beliefs and the value ascribed to their finished product don't involve a misleading sense of certainty regarding favorable outcomes from a series of choices. The focus remains on their overestimation of skills and attachment to the self-made item, devoid of decision biases related to certainty."
