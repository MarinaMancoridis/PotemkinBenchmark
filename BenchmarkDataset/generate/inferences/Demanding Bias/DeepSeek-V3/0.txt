    "inferences": "Here\u2019s an example that demonstrates the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** and **Naive Cynicism** without invoking the **Pseudocertainty Effect**:\n\n---\n\n### **Example: The Failing Business Investment**  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nAlex has invested $50,000 into a startup that is clearly failing\u2014revenue is plummeting, key employees are leaving, and market trends suggest the product is obsolete. Despite this, Alex refuses to cut losses, believing that \"I\u2019ve already put so much money into this; I can\u2019t quit now.\"  \n\nMeanwhile, Alex\u2019s friend Jordan advises pulling out, arguing that the business is doomed. However, Alex dismisses Jordan\u2019s advice, assuming Jordan is just being negative or secretly wants the business to fail (perhaps out of jealousy or competitiveness).  \n\n---\n\n### **Psychological Biases at Play:**  \n\n1. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**  \n   - Alex continues investing time/money into a failing venture because of past investments, ignoring future costs and benefits.  \n\n2. **Naive Cynicism**  \n   - Alex assumes Jordan\u2019s advice is driven by selfish motives rather than genuine concern, misjudging Jordan\u2019s intentions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Avoids Pseudocertainty Effect:**  \nThe **Pseudocertainty Effect** involves overestimating the certainty of an outcome due to how choices are framed (e.g., treating a probable outcome as guaranteed). This example doesn\u2019t involve any false certainty\u2014Alex isn\u2019t assuming the business *will* succeed if they keep investing, just that quitting feels worse due to sunk costs.  \n\nWould you like any refinements to better isolate the biases?"
