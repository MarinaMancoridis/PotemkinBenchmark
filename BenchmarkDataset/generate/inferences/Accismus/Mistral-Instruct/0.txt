The reflection showed a man, his eyes hollow, his spirit weary, a prisoner of his own vanity. He longed to see the radiant shine of his former self, but instead, he saw a faded image, a shadow of his past glory. This was accismus, his self-inflicted torment, a fear of his own beauty fading, a fear of the shine no longer being there."
