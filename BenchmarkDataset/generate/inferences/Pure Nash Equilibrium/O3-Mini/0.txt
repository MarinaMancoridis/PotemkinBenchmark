In the 3x3 matrix below, there must be one particular combination of strategies that serves as a Nash Equilibrium. For Player 1 in the given row, we'll assign payoffs of [7, 2, 3] across the row when Player 2 chooses the corresponding strategies.\n\nLet's assume the Nash Equilibrium occurs when Player 2 selects their first strategy, and we've set up the payoffs such that Player 1's best response in that situation yields the highest payoff.\n\nThe matrix will be constructed to ensure that these conditions hold.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (7,4), (2,5), (3,1) ],\n [ (5,3), (8,2), (6,4) ],\n [ (9,6), (5,7), (4,8) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
