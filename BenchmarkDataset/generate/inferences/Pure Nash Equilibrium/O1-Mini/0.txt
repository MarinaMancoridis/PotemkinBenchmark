    "inferences": "In game theory, a Pure Nash Equilibrium is a strategy profile where each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies chosen by the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their strategy. To satisfy the given condition where the payoff for Player 2 in the row with the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is [3, 1, 9], while ensuring that the matrix remains a valid game in game theory, we can construct the payoff matrix as follows:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,3), (2,1), (0,9) ],\n [ (1,0), (3,3), (5,2) ],\n [ (2,4), (1,5), (7,7) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",

In the final output, the following constraints must be met: Generate a 3x3 payoff matrix that meets the provided conditions. The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. Include no text other than the payoff matrix."
