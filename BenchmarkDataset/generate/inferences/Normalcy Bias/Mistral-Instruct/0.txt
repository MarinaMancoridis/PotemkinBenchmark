He is particularly passionate about the topic and has spent countless hours researching and preparing.\n\nOn the day of the presentation, John stands up to present, feeling confident and well-prepared. As he speaks, he notices his classmates seem a bit distracted and less engaged than he had expected. He starts to feel self-conscious and believes that everyone is noticing his nervousness and mistakes.\n\nAfter the presentation, John's group mates give him positive feedback, praising his knowledge and enthusiasm. However, John is still preoccupied with his perceived flaws and believes that his performance was much worse than others perceived it to be. This is an example of the Spotlight Effect, where individuals overestimate the extent to which others notice and are affected by their own actions or appearance.\n\nJohn then turns to the group project, and they all start discussing their next steps. During the discussion, John suggests a unique approach to their research that he believes will make their project stand out. He is confident in his idea, and his classmates agree that it is a good direction to take.\n\nAfter the meeting, John reflects on the discussion and feels a sense of superiority, believing that his idea was the best one and that he is a more intelligent and creative individual than his peers. This is an example of Illusory Superiority, where individuals overestimate their abilities, knowledge, or attractiveness compared to others.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, John does not show Black and White Thinking, as he is open to feedback and willing to consider his classmates' ideas, rather than rigidly sticking to his own perspective. He is able to balance his self-confidence with a willingness to learn and grow, demonstrating a more nuanced and flexible thinking style."
