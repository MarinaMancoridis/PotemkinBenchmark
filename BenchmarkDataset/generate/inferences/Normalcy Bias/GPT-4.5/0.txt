    "inferences": "Sure, let's create a scenario that demonstrates the IKEA Effect and Demanding Bias while avoiding Catastrophizing.\n\n---\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nSarah recently purchased a new bookshelf from a store that requires self-assembly - let's say it's from IKEA. She spent a weekend painstakingly putting it together, following each step meticulously. Even though the assembly was challenging and took longer than expected, Sarah felt a deep sense of accomplishment once it was finally complete. This is an example of the **IKEA Effect**: Sarah values the bookshelf more highly because she invested her own effort into assembling it.\n\nA few weeks later, Sarah's friend, Jessica, comes over for a visit. Jessica admires the bookshelf and mentions she plans to get a similar one. Sarah, proud of her handiwork, insists that Jessica should also assemble it herself to truly appreciate its value. Sarah is demonstrating the **Demanding Bias** here by believing that what was important and valuable for her (assembling it herself) should be the same for Jessica, assuming her own preferences are universally applicable.\n\nIn this scenario, there is no presence of **Catastrophizing**, as there is no focus on irrationally predicting or expecting disastrous outcomes. Sarah is simply experiencing and projecting the heightened valuation of the bookshelf due to her own involvement in its assembly, and there is no exaggerated negative outcome or fear present."
