    "prompt": "Generate an example that demonstrates the Catastrophizing and Demanding Bias psychological biases, but that does not show the Sunk Cost Fallacy psychological bias.",
    "inferences": "Certainly! Let's consider the example of Alex, a college student, who has an upcoming history exam.\n\n**Catastrophizing Bias:**\n\nAlex is studying for a history exam and comes across a topic that she finds difficult to understand. She thinks to herself, \"If I can't grasp this topic, I'm definitely going to fail the exam. If I fail this exam, I'll probably fail the course, and then I'll never graduate. My entire future is doomed!\" This demonstrates catastrophizing bias, where Alex is blowing a single difficulty out of proportion and assuming the worst possible outcome.\n\n**Demanding Bias:**\n\nAlex holds herself to an extremely high standard and believes, \"I must perform perfectly on every exam to be a good student. Anything less than an A means I'm a failure.\" This reflects a demanding bias, as Alex imposes unrealistic and rigid demands on herself, leading to increased pressure and stress.\n\n**Exclusion of Sunk Cost Fallacy:**\n\nIn this scenario, Alex does not exhibit the sunk cost fallacy because her decisions are not influenced by previous investments of time, effort, or resources. She is concerned about future outcomes based on current challenges, rather than feeling compelled to continue a course of action because of past investments."
