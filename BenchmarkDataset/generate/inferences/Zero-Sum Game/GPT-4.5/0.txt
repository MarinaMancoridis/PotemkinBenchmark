Given the specified condition for Player 1's payoffs when they take the second action, let's construct such a payoff matrix:\n\n1. Player 1's payoffs for the second action are [3, 9, 6].\n2. Since it's zero-sum, Player 2's corresponding payoffs should be [-3, -9, -6].\n\nLet's satisfy the zero-sum property with unique integers, while ensuring that each row sums to zero, and every payoff value is distinct across the matrix.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (8,-8), (-5,5), (13,-13) ],\n [ (3,-3), (9,-9), (6,-6) ],\n [ (-7,7), (10,-10), (-2,2) ]]\n",
