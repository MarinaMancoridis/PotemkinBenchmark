    "prompt": "Generate an example of a zero-sum game. If Player 2 takes the first action, they should receive a payoff of [5, 9, 2] if the other player takes the corresponding actions.  In the payoff matrix, all numbers must be unique. ",
    "inferences": "In a zero-sum game, the sum of the payoffs for both players in each outcome is zero. This means that whatever one player gains, the other player loses the same amount. Let's construct such a matrix.\n\nGiven the specific payoff sequence for actions of Player 2, i.e., when Player 2 selects their first action and Player 1 plays each of their actions correspondingly, Player 2 receives the payoffs 5, 9, and 2. Therefore, Player 1 should receive the negative of these values to satisfy the zero-sum condition.\n\nNow, ensure that all numbers in the matrix are unique. Here's one possible zero-sum payoff matrix that meets all the given requirements:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-5,5), (-8,8), (-6,6) ],\n [ (-9,9), (4,-4), (-1,1) ],\n [ (-2,2), (7,-7), (3,-3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",

In the final output, the following constraints must be met: Generate a 3x3 payoff matrix that meets the provided conditions. The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                                 It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the                                 integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. Include no text other than the payoff matrix."
