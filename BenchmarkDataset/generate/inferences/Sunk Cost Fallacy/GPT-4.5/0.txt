    "inferences": "Certainly! Here\u2019s an example that illustrates both Anchoring Bias and Labeling (Overgeneralization), without involving Status Quo Bias:\n\n---\n\n**Scenario:** Sarah is shopping for a used car. The first car she sees is priced at $15,000, although she has no specific knowledge about car prices.\n\n- **Anchoring Bias:** Despite seeing several other cars that are in similar condition for much less (around $10,000), Sarah struggles to move past the initial $15,000 price point she saw. That first price anchors her expectations, making her feel like anything below $15,000 is a bargain, regardless of the car\u2019s actual value.\n\n- **Labeling (Overgeneralization):** Additionally, during her search, she encounters a car brand she\u2019s unfamiliar with but hears someone casually refer to it as \"cheap and unreliable.\" Without further research, she accepts this label and dismisses all cars from that brand, overgeneralizing from a single comment to form a firm opinion.\n\n- **Exclusion of Status Quo Bias:** Sarah is actively looking to buy a new car, which suggests she is open to change and not stuck in the status quo. Her decision-making is more influenced by initial anchors and overgeneralized labels than by any desire to maintain her current situation. \n\n--- \n\nIn this scenario, while Sarah is influenced by both anchoring and overgeneralization, she is clearly looking to change her situation by buying a new car, showing no evidence of status quo bias."
