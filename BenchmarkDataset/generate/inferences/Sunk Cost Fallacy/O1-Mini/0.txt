    "inferences": "Example Scenario:\n\n**Setting:** You are shopping for a used car and have little experience with cars or car prices.\n\n**Anchoring Bias:**\n\nWhen you enter the dealership, the first car you see is priced at $15,000. This price becomes your reference point, or \"anchor,\" for evaluating other cars. As you look around, you see another car that is priced at $13,000. Because of the anchoring effect, you perceive this car as a great deal compared to the initial $15,000 car, even though you haven't assessed its actual value or compared it to market average prices.\n\n**Labeling (Overgeneralization):**\n\nWhile inspecting the cars, you meet a salesperson who makes a negative comment about a certain car brand, saying, \"These cars are always unreliable.\" Despite only hearing this single opinion, you overgeneralize and label the entire brand as unreliable. This labeling influences your decision-making, leading you to avoid cars from that brand without further investigation.\n\n**Exclusion of Status Quo Bias:**\n\nIn this scenario, there is no resistance to change or preference for maintaining current circumstances, which characterizes the Status Quo Bias. You are actively seeking to purchase a car, indicating a willingness to change your current state of not having a vehicle."
