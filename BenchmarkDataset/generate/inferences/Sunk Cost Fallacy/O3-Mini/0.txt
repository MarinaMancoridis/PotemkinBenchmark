    "inferences": "**Scenario:**\n\nEmily is a graphic designer working on a major project for an important client. Despite having received positive feedback on her work throughout the project, she is fixated on a minor error she made during the final presentation.\n\n**Catastrophizing:**\n\nAfter the presentation, Emily receives an email from the client praising the overall design and creativity but also pointing out a small mistake in one of the slides. Although the feedback is mostly positive, Emily's mind races, and she begins to catastrophize: she imagines the client deciding to terminate the contract, her boss getting angry, and ultimately losing her job.\n\n**Mental Filtering (Disqualifying the Positive):**\n\nEmily dismisses the positive remarks in the email and focuses entirely on the criticism. Her colleagues and manager congratulate her on a job well done, but she brushes off their compliments, believing they are just being polite. In her mind, the only thing that matters is the mistake, and she feels like a failure despite the project's success.\n\n**Absence of Overconfidence:**\n\nThroughout this process, Emily does not exhibit overconfidence. Instead of overestimating her abilities or underestimating the challenges, she is doubtful about her performance and hyper-focuses on her mistake. Her lack of confidence further fuels her catastrophizing and mental filtering, as she does not believe the positive feedback reflects her true capabilities."
