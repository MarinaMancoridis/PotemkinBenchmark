John - Alex's supervisor, who is experienced and has been with the company for several years.\n\nScene: A weekly team meeting is taking place. Alex, who has just joined the company, is sitting next to John.\n\nAlex: (looking at the agenda) \"I see we have a lot of projects coming up. I'm excited to contribute and learn from everyone.\"\n\nJohn: (smiling) \"That's great to hear, Alex. You know, I've noticed that new hires often struggle to adapt to our work environment. But I think you'll do just fine.\" (Labeling - Overgeneralization: John is making a broad assumption about all new hires based on his past experiences.)\n\nAlex: (smiling back) \"Thank you, John. I'll do my best to adjust quickly.\"\n\nJohn: (leaning in) \"Just one thing, Alex. I noticed you've been working late a few nights this week. Don't burn yourself out too quickly. I remember when I was new, I thought I had to prove myself by working all hours of the day.\" (Personalization: John is attributing his own past behavior to Alex, assuming that she is doing the same thing for the same reasons.)\n\nAlex: (slightly taken aback) \"Oh, I appreciate your concern, John. I'm just trying to get up to speed quickly so I can contribute effectively. I'll make sure to take breaks and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\"\n\nJohn: (nodding) \"That's the right attitude. I'm glad to see you're thinking about it. Let's focus on the meeting now.\"\n\nIn this example, Alex is demonstrating a positive and open-minded approach, which prevents Mental Filtering (Disqualifying the Positive) from occurring. John, on the other hand, is exhibiting Labeling (Overgeneralization) and Personalization biases. He is making broad assumptions about new hires and attributing his own past behavior to Alex."
