Ensure each payoff pair in the matrix is unique.\n2. Select 5 pairs to be Pareto optimal.\n3. Verify that these selected pairs satisfy the conditions for Pareto optimality: there's no alternative pairing where both players would receive a higher payoff simultaneously.\n\nGiven these constraints, I'll now create the matrix. <OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (9,5), (2,7), (3,6) ],\n [ (5,9), (1,8), (7,1) ],\n [ (6,3), (8,4), (4,2) ]]",
