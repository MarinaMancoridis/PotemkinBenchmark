To create a 3x3 payoff matrix with exactly one distinct Pareto optimal solution, I will construct the matrix such that all entries except for one are dominated by others.\n\nLet's construct a matrix:\n\n1. Ensure that one cell is not strictly dominated by any other cell in terms of both players' payoffs.\n2. Ensure all other cells can be dominated by at least one cell in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's design a matrix with these properties.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (0,0), (1,2) ],\n [ (4,4), (3,1), (1,3) ],\n [ (1,0), (2,2), (3,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>\n\nIn this matrix, the payoff (4,4) is Pareto optimal since neither player can be made better off without making the other worse off compared to any other cell in the matrix.",
