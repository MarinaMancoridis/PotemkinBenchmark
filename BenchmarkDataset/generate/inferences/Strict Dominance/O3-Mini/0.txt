In the column that is stricly dominant for Player 2, Player 2 receives a payoff of [1, 5, 6] if the other player takes the corresponding actions.  ",
    "inferences": "A strictly dominant strategy for a player in a game is one where, regardless of what the other player does, the chosen strategy provides a higher payoff. To construct a game with a strictly dominant strategy for only Player 2, we will create a 3x3 matrix. Player 2's strictly dominant column will provide payoffs of [1, 5, 6] for Player 2's actions. Player 1 will not have a strictly dominant strategy. Here's the payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (1,0), (4,0) ],\n [ (2,5), (2,4), (1,1) ],\n [ (0,6), (3,2), (2,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",

In the final output, the following constraints must be met: Generate a 3x3 payoff matrix that meets the provided conditions. The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. Include no text other than the payoff matrix."
