Alex - A person who tends to exhibit Demanding Bias and Catastrophizing.\n2. Jamie - A friend who tries to help Alex.\n\nScene: Alex and Jamie are discussing an upcoming concert.\n\nAlex: I can't believe I forgot about the concert next weekend! I was so excited to go, and now I've missed out on getting tickets.\n\nJamie: Hey, it's just a ticket. There are probably still some available online. Let's check.\n\nAlex: (panicking) No, it's not just a ticket! This is my favorite band, and I've been waiting for years to see them live. Now I've ruined everything!\n\n(Jamie notices Alex's Demanding Bias, as Alex is expecting to get tickets even though they were not purchased in advance.)\n\nJamie: Calm down, Alex. It's not the end of the world. Let's see what's available online.\n\nAlex: (catastrophizing) But what if they're all sold out? What if the only tickets left are way in the back? I'll have a terrible view, and the experience will be ruined!\n\n(Jamie tries to help Alex, but Alex's thoughts continue to spiral into negative outcomes.)\n\nJamie: Alex, let's not jump to conclusions. There are still plenty of tickets available. Let's focus on finding good seats and enjoying the concert.\n\nAlex: (still anxious) I don't know, Jamie. I just can't shake this feeling that everything is going wrong. I'm such a mess.\n\n(Jamie realizes that Alex is catastrophizing the situation and tries to reassure them.)\n\nJamie: Alex, it's okay to feel upset, but let's not let our emotions control us. Let's take a deep breath, find some tickets, and make the most of this opportunity.\n\nIn this example, Alex demonstrates Demanding Bias by expecting to get tickets even though they were not purchased in advance, and Catastrophizing by assuming the worst-case scenario and allowing their emotions to control their thoughts. The Endowment Effect is not shown in this scenario because Alex does not exhibit an unwillingness to sell their own tickets at a higher price than their perceived value."
