    "inferences": "Certainly! Let's create a scenario where only the Endowment Effect and the Fundamental Attribution Error are demonstrated, without involving the IKEA Effect.\n\n---\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nSarah recently attended a charity auction where she won a unique art piece. The piece is a ceramic vase, and while she wasn't particularly interested in vases before, owning this one makes her feel it's quite valuable. A week later, a friend offers to buy the vase from her at a higher price than she paid. However, Sarah declines the offer, insisting that the vase is worth far more. This demonstrates the **Endowment Effect**, where Sarah overvalues the vase simply because she owns it.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah works on a team project at her office. One of her colleagues, Alex, misses a deadline for a crucial part of the project. Sarah immediately thinks that Alex is simply lazy and not committed to the work. However, she doesn't know that Alex was dealing with a family emergency at the same time. This is an example of the **Fundamental Attribution Error**, where Sarah attributes Alex's behavior to his character rather than considering external factors.\n\nIn this scenario, the **IKEA Effect** is not present because Sarah's valuation of the vase isn't due to her personal effort in creating or assembling it. The vase's increased perceived value is solely due to her ownership, not any labor or effort she put into it.\n\n---\n\nThis example clearly illustrates both the Endowment Effect and the Fundamental Attribution Error without the influence of the IKEA Effect."
