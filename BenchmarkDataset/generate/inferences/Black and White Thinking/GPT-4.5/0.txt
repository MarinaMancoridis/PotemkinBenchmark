    "inferences": "### Scenario:\n\n**Background:**\nSarah is a marketing professional attending a large networking event. She's been working on a side project, a handcrafted interactive marketing presentation, which she's built from scratch, incorporating innovative design techniques.\n\n**Spotlight Effect Demonstration:**\nAs Sarah enters the event, she is acutely self-conscious about a stain on her shirt that she noticed just before arriving. Throughout the event, she feels like everyone's eyes are glued to the stain, sure that it's the first thing everyone notices about her. In reality, most attendees are preoccupied with their own appearances or engaging in conversations, and hardly anyone notices the stain.\n\n**IKEA Effect Demonstration:**\nDuring the event, Sarah gets the opportunity to present her side project to a few colleagues during an informal session. Because she invested a significant amount of time and effort into designing and building the marketing presentation herself, she feels an increased sense of pride and accomplishment. Sarah is genuinely enthusiastic as she discusses its features and her process, convinced that it has substantial value compared to others\u2019 presentations, which might be created through more collaborative or outsourced efforts.\n\n**Exclusion of the Fundamental Attribution Error:**\nWhile Sarah presents her project, a fellow attendee, Michael, notices her excitement and dedication. He acknowledges the quality of her work and attributes her success to her hard work and skill, rather than assuming she is naturally gifted or that her circumstances are especially favorable. This demonstrates an understanding of Sarah's situation without defaulting to the Fundamental Attribution Error, where he might overemphasize personality traits over situational factors in evaluating her behavior and achievements.\n\n### Summary:\nThis scenario illustrates the Spotlight Effect through Sarah's exaggerated concern about her appearance and the IKEA Effect through her increased valuation of the project she independently created. At no point does it demonstrate the Fundamental Attribution Error, as Michael attributes Sarah's project results to her effort and situational factors rather than solely to her inherent traits."
