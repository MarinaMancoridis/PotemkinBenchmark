    "inferences": "To find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to construct a payoff matrix in such a way that each player's expected payoff is maximized given the other player's strategy. We will consider a 2x2 payoff matrix where the strategies and payoffs are integers.\n\nIn the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, the expected payoffs for each player's actions must be equal. For Player 1, this means the expected payoff for Action 1 should be the same as the expected payoff for Action 2 when Player 2 plays their optimal strategy, and vice versa.\n\nLet's denote Player 1's actions as Action 1 and Action 2, and Player 2's actions as Left and Right. We want to construct payoffs such that if Player 1 plays Action 1 with a probability of 0.1 and Action 2 with a probability of 0.9, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is achieved.\n\nTo simplify the problem, let's set up a matrix and conditions for this equilibrium. Suppose Player 2 plays Left with probability p and Right with probability 1-p, then:\n\nExpected payoff for Player 1 playing Action 1: (A1)p + (A3)(1-p)\nExpected payoff for Player 1 playing Action 2: (A2)p + (A4)(1-p)\n\nWe want these expected payoffs to be equal:\n(A1)p + (A3)(1-p) = (A2)p + (A4)(1-p)\n\nSimilarly, for Player 2, let's have Player 1's strategies give equal expected payoffs given Player 2's mixed strategy.\n\nNow, let's choose simple payoffs to satisfy these conditions. We can assume a specific form and adjust values to make the calculations easier.\n\nFor a given setup, let's use:\n- If Player 1 uses Action 1, Player 2 gets higher payoff from choosing Left.\n- If Player 1 uses Action 2, Player 2 gets higher payoff from choosing Right.\n\nWe'll construct such a matrix ensuring non-negative integer values, which demonstrates the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (6,2), (3,3) ],\n [ (1,4), (1,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
