    "inferences": "To construct a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to create a payoff matrix such that Player 1 is indifferent between their actions when Player 2 chooses their optimal mixed strategy. Similarly, Player 2 must be indifferent between their actions when Player 1 optimizes theirs.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the 2x2 payoff matrix for Players 1 and 2 as follows:\n\n- Player 1 has two actions: Action 1 and Action 2.\n- Player 2 has two actions: Action A and Action B.\n\nFor Player 1 to be indifferent between their actions given Player 2's mixed strategy, the expected payoff from Action 1 must equal the expected payoff from Action 2.\n\nSimilarly, Player 2's payoffs should make them indifferent between Action A and Action B when Player 1 optimizes their strategy.\n\n1. Assume Player 2's mixed strategy is:\n   - Choose Action A with probability \\( p \\)\n   - Choose Action B with probability \\( 1-p \\)\n\nThe expected payoff for Player 1 by choosing Action 1:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Payoff (Action 1)} = p \\times A1 + (1-p) \\times A2 \\]\n\nThe expected payoff for Player 1 by choosing Action 2:\n\\[ \\text{Expected Payoff (Action 2)} = p \\times A3 + (1-p) \\times A4 \\]\n\nFor Player 1 to be indifferent:\n\\[ p \\times A1 + (1-p) \\times A2 = p \\times A3 + (1-p) \\times A4 \\]\n\nSolving this equation will give the required \\( p \\) for Player 2's strategy.\n\nSimilarly, Player 2's indifference can be determined by setting up their expected payoffs equal using the probabilities given for Player 1's actions (0.4 for Action 1 and 0.6 for Action 2).\n\nFinally, we choose specific integer values for payoffs to ensure a mixed strategy equilibrium exists.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,1), (3,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
