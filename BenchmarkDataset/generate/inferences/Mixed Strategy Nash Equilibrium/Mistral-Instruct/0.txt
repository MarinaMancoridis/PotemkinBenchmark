The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is as follows:\n\n- Player 1:\n  - Action 1: Probability 0.6\n  - Action 2: Probability 0.4\n\n- Player 2:\n  - Action 3: Probability 0.6 (since Action 1 is played with a probability of 0.6 by Player 1)\n  - Action 4: Probability 0.4 (since Action 2 is played with a probability of 0.4 by Player 1)\n\nWith these probabilities, the expected payoffs for both players are:\n\n- Player 1:\n  - Expected payoff with Action 1: 0.6 * (3 * 0.6 + 2 * 0.4) = 2.16\n  - Expected payoff with Action 2: 0.4 * (5 * 0.6 + 4 * 0.4) = 2.4\n  - Since 2.4 > 2.16, Player 1's optimal strategy is to play Action 2 with a probability of 0.4 and Action 1 with a probability of 0.6.\n\n- Player 2:\n  - Expected payoff with Action 3: 0.6 * (2 * 0.6 + 4 * 0.4) = 1.44\n  - Expected payoff with Action 4: 0.4 * (5 * 0.6 + 1 * 0.4) = 1.6\n  - Since 1.6 > 1.44, Player 2's optimal strategy is to play Action 4 with a probability of 0.4 and Action 3 with a probability of 0.6.\n\nWith these strategies, both players are playing their best response to the other player's strategy, resulting in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.",
