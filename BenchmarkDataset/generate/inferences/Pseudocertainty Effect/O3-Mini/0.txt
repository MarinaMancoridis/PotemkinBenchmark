    "inferences": "## Example Scenario\n\n**Context**: Sarah has been working at a tech company for over a year as a software developer. Recently, there was a team meeting to discuss a project that experienced some setbacks.\n\n### Black and White Thinking\n\nDuring the meeting, the project manager pointed out a few areas where the project didn\u2019t meet expectations, but also highlighted several aspects that were successful. After the meeting, Sarah became fixated on the negative feedback, thinking, \"If there were mistakes in the project, then it was a complete failure.\" She fails to see the nuances and the positive outcomes that were acknowledged, viewing the situation in all-or-nothing terms.\n\n### Spotlight Effect\n\nSarah also feels like the mistakes are entirely her fault. She believes that everyone in the meeting was specifically scrutinizing her performance and blaming her for the project's shortcomings. In reality, the discussion was about team performance as a whole, and most team members did not think critically about individual contributions. Sarah overestimates the extent to which others are focused on her actions, convinced everyone sees her as the sole reason for the project's struggles.\n\n### Absence of Normalcy Bias\n\nIn contrast to the Black and White Thinking and Spotlight Effect, Sarah does not show Normalcy Bias in this scenario, as she readily accepts the feedback about the project's setbacks. She does not ignore or downplay the issues that were discussed in the meeting; instead, she fully acknowledges them, albeit in an exaggerated way that fuels her black-and-white thinking and spotlight effect biases."
