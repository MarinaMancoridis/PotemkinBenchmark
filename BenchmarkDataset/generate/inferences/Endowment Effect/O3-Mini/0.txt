    "inferences": "### Scenario\n\n**Context:** Sarah is a manager at a small printing business. Recently, there have been significant technological advancements in the printing industry, introducing more efficient, cost-effective digital printers. However, Sarah's company continues using its decade-old machinery, resulting in higher operational costs and longer production times compared to competitors. The company is already struggling financially but has invested heavily in maintaining their current equipment over the years.\n\n**Normalcy Bias:**\nDespite industry reports and feedback from employees suggesting that upgrading to new digital printers is essential for staying competitive, Sarah believes that the current challenges will soon pass and insists on maintaining the status quo, thinking, \"We've managed this way for years; things will get back to normal soon enough.\"\n\n**Sunk Cost Fallacy:**\nSarah is reluctant to invest in new printers because of the substantial amount of money already spent on the existing machines. She argues, \"We've put so much into these machines, it would be wasteful to abandon them now,\" ignoring the fact that newer technology would reduce costs and increase efficiency in the long run.\n\n**Absence of the Spotlight Effect:**\nThroughout this decision-making process, Sarah is not particularly concerned about what others in the industry think of her choices. She prioritizes internal discussions and data over perceived external judgments, demonstrating that her focus is more on the company's perceived financial stability rather than how others may view her management decisions. \n\nIn this scenario, Sarah's actions illustrate the Normalcy Bias and Sunk Cost Fallacy, as she is overly reliant on past practices and previous investments. However, there is an absence of the Spotlight Effect, as her concern is not about being scrutinized by others."
