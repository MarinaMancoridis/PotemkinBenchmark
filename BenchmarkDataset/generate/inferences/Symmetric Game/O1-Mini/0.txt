    "inferences": "To construct a symmetric game where Player 2 receives payoffs of [8, 4, 7] when they take the first action, we need to ensure that Player 1 receives the same payoffs when they mirror these actions. A symmetric game means that if the players swap strategies, the payoffs swap accordingly. This requires careful allocation of values in the payoff matrix.\n\nLet's construct the matrix:\n\n1. When Player 1 chooses the first action, if Player 2 chooses the first, second, or third actions respectively, they'll receive payoffs [8, 4, 7].\n2.
