    "inferences": "In a symmetric game, the payoff for each player when they take a certain action against an opponent's action is the same if their roles are reversed. Therefore, to meet this condition, if Player 1 also takes the third action against Player 2, the payoff to Player 1 should be [2, 4, 0] when Player 2 takes the corresponding actions.\n\nTo build a 3x3 symmetric payoff matrix based on the given condition, we start with aligning the third action payoffs as specified. We then fill out the rest of the matrix to maintain symmetry, ensuring that the payoff (Ai, Bi) matches at position [i, j] and [j, i] for any i and j.\n\nHere's the constructed payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (3,0), (2,0) ],\n [ (0,3), (4,4), (4,4) ],\n [ (0,2), (4,2), (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",

In the final output, the following constraints must be met: Generate a 3x3 payoff matrix that meets the provided conditions. The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. Include no text other than the payoff matrix."
