    "inferences": "A symmetric game is one in which the payoffs are identical for each player, assuming they swap strategies. Given your conditions and ensuring the game remains symmetric, we need to craft the payoff matrix so that Player 2's payoff reflects the symmetry with Player 1's actions. \n\nFor Player 1 taking the second action:\n\n- If Player 2 also takes the first action, the payoff for Player 1 is 0.\n- If Player 2 takes the second action, the payoff for Player 1 is 2.\n- If Player 2 takes the third action, the payoff for Player 1 is 1.\n\nSince it's symmetric, these payoffs must also be reflected for Player 2 when Player 2 takes the second action and Player 1 takes the corresponding actions. Thus, the (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2) positions for Player 2 will be [0, 2, 1] respectively. Similarly, the second column for other corresponding actions must match.\n\nNow, we construct the 3x3 payoff matrix meeting these criteria:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,0), (1,1) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,2), (1,1) ],\n [ (1,1), (1,1), (0,0) ]]\n",

It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
