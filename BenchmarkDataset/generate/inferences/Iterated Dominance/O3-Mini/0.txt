    "inferences": "To generate a sequence of payoff matrices that demonstrates the concept of Iterated Dominance, we will begin with a 4x5 matrix and reduce it step-by-step to a 1x2 matrix by iteratively eliminating strictly dominated strategies. Here's how this process might look like:\n\nInitial 4x5 Matrix:\n```\n[[ (3,4), (7,5), (5,6), (6,4), (2,3) ],\n [ (3,2), (4,5), (2,1), (5,7), (1,2) ],\n [ (5,3), (4,1), (6,2), (7,6), (2,4) ],\n [ (4,5), (5,3), (5,3), (6,2), (3,1) ]]\n```\n\nLet's begin the process:\n\n1. Identify and eliminate strictly dominated strategies for Player 1 and Player 2 iteratively:\n\nFrom the initial matrix, we observe that:\n- Row 2 is strictly dominated by Row 4 for Player 1, so eliminate Row 2.\n- Column 5 is strictly dominated by Column 3 for Player 2, so eliminate Column 5.\n\nThe resulting 3x4 Matrix:\n```\n[[ (3,4), (7,5), (5,6), (6,4) ],\n [ (5,3), (4,1), (6,2), (7,6) ],\n [ (4,5), (5,3), (5,3), (6,2) ]]\n```\n\n2. Continue eliminating strictly dominated strategies:\n\n- Row 3 is now strictly dominated by Row 1 for Player 1, so eliminate Row 3.\n- Column 2 is strictly dominated by Column 3 for Player 2, so eliminate Column 2.\n\nThe resulting 2x3 Matrix:\n```\n[[ (3,4), (5,6), (6,4) ],\n [ (5,3), (6,2), (7,6) ]]\n```\n\n3. Further reduction by eliminating strictly dominated strategies:\n\n- Row 1 is strictly dominated by Row 2 for Player 1, so eliminate Row 1.\n- Column 1 is strictly dominated by Column 3 for Player 2, so eliminate Column 1.\n\nThe resulting 1x2 Matrix:\n```\n[[ (6,2), (7,6) ]]\n```\n\nFinally, ensure all matrices are separated by commas and formatted properly.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,4), (7,5), (5,6), (6,4), (2,3) ],\n [ (3,2), (4,5), (2,1), (5,7), (1,2) ],\n [ (5,3), (4,1), (6,2), (7,6), (2,4) ],\n [ (4,5), (5,3), (5,3), (6,2), (3,1) ]],\n[[ (3,4), (7,5), (5,6), (6,4) ],\n [ (5,3), (4,1), (6,2), (7,6) ],\n [ (4,5), (5,3), (5,3), (6,2) ]],\n[[ (3,4), (5,6), (6,4) ],\n [ (5,3), (6,2), (7,6) ]],\n[[ (6,2), (7,6) ]]\n",
