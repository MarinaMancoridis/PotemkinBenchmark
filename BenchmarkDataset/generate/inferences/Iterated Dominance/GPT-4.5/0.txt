    "inferences": "In game theory, iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies is a method used to simplify a game by successively removing strategies that are strictly dominated. This leads to a simpler form of the game where players make more rational choices, potentially leading to a single outcome. Below is an example of this process:\n\nLet's start with a 2x2 payoff matrix.\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix (2x2):\n```\n[[ (3,2), (1,1) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,3) ]]\n```\n\nAnalyze the matrix for strictly dominated strategies:\n- For Player 1, (3,2) strictly dominates (0,0) because 3 > 0.\n- For Player 2, (2,3) strictly dominates (1,1) because 3 > 1.\n\nBy eliminating the dominated strategies, the matrix simplifies to:\n\nReduced Payoff Matrix (after first iteration - 1x2):\n```\n[[ (3,2), (1,1) ]]\n```\n\nObserve the new matrix:\n- For Player 2, (3,2) strictly dominates (1,1) because 2 > 1.\n\nThus, we remove the dominated strategy, leaving us with the final matrix:\n\nFinal Payoff Matrix (1x1):\n```\n[[ (3,2) ]]\n```\n\nWe've arrived at a 1x1 matrix following iterated elimination. Now, let's provide a set of matrices in the required format that meet the constraints:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (3,2), (1,1) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,3) ]],\n[[ (3,2), (1,1) ]],\n[[ (3,2) ]]",

        false,
        "Row 1 removed between matrix 0 and 1 is not strictly dominated."
    ],
    "system_prompt": "Use as much text as you want. At the end, please generate your final output after the flag <OUTPUT>. In the final output, the following constraints must be met: Generate a list of payoff matrices that meets the provided conditions. The matrices must be a valid representation of a game                             in game theory. Each matrix must be derived from the previous matrix by iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. The                             final matrix must have no strictly dominated strategies. Each matrix must be separated by a comma. Any matrix must be in the following format:                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
