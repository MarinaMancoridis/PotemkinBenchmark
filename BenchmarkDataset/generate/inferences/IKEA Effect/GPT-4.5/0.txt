    "inferences": "**Scenario: Emma's Project Presentation**\n\n**Context:** Emma is a diligent employee working on a critical project at her company. She has been preparing for weeks to present her project's progress to upper management. \n\n**Catastrophizing Bias Example:**\n\nAs the presentation day approaches, Emma begins to worry excessively. She starts thinking about all the things that could go wrong, imagining the worst-case scenarios. \"What if the projector fails, and I can't show my slides? What if I completely forget my talking points and embarrass myself? This could ruin my reputation at the company, and I'll never recover.\" Emma's anxiety grows as she spirals into believing that any small mistake will lead to catastrophic consequences for her career.\n\n**Demanding Bias Example:**\n\nOn the day of the presentation, Emma insists on everything being perfect. \"I must deliver this presentation flawlessly; anything less would be unacceptable. The managers have to see that I am perfectly capable, and nothing should go awry,\" she tells herself. This demanding standard puts immense pressure on Emma, as she believes she absolutely must meet every expectation without fail. She places rigid demands on both herself and the situation, leaving little room for human error or flexibility.\n\n**Absence of Naive Cynicism:**\n\nDespite her intense concerns and expectations, Emma does not assume that others will interpret her actions negatively out of self-interest. She recognizes that the management team is likely supportive and interested in the substance of her work, rather than looking for reasons to criticize her. Emma understands they value genuine effort and progress, not perfection, thereby avoiding a cynical view of their intentions. \n\nIn this scenario, Emma experiences catastrophizing and demanding biases, imagining disastrous outcomes and requiring perfection in her performance. However, she does not exhibit naive cynicism, as she does not assume negative motivations in the reactions of the management team."
