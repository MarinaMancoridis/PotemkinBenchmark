    "inferences": "Sure, here's an illustrative example demonstrating the IKEA Effect and Illusory Superiority without displaying Normalcy Bias:\n\n---\n\n**Example: The DIY Birdhouse Project**\n\nAlice decided to build a birdhouse to hang in her backyard. She purchased a DIY birdhouse kit from a local store, which included all the necessary parts and instructions. Although she had never built anything like this before, Alice spent a weekend assembling the birdhouse. She meticulously followed the instructions and even added a few personal touches with paint.\n\nAs a result of her effort and investment, Alice felt a strong attachment to her completed birdhouse. Despite its slightly crooked roof and uneven paint job, she was immensely proud of her creation. This demonstrates the **IKEA Effect**, where individuals place a disproportionately high value on products they have partially created.\n\nExcited about her success, Alice began to believe she had a natural talent for woodworking. She started evaluating her birdhouse against those built by more experienced woodworkers in her neighborhood. When her friend Bob, who had years of woodworking experience, showed her a birdhouse he crafted from scratch, Alice commented on its lack of \"personal flair\" compared to hers.\n\nAlice's belief that her skill level was superior to what it truly was, despite her limited experience, is an example of the **Illusory Superiority** bias. She overestimated her abilities based on this one successful project.\n\nThis scenario does not exhibit the **Normalcy Bias**, as there is no indication of Alice underestimating or denying the potential of new circumstances affecting her environment or routine. Instead, it focuses on her emotional investment in a project and her inflated assessment of her skills relative to others."
