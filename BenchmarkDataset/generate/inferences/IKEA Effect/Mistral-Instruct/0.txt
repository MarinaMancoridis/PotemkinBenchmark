Bella - A young artist, recently graduated from a prestigious art school, with a unique style.\n\nScene: An exclusive art gallery, showcasing Bella's first solo exhibition.\n\nAlex, upon entering the gallery, is immediately drawn to one of Bella's pieces, a vibrant abstract painting that catches his eye. He approaches the gallery owner, who explains the piece's background and price.\n\nAlex (Demanding Bias): \"This painting is not worth that much. I've seen similar pieces by less established artists for a fraction of the price.\"\n\nThe gallery owner, taken aback, explains that Bella is a promising new talent, and her works are highly sought after by collectors.\n\nAlex (Black and White Thinking): \"If it's not a masterpiece, it's worthless. I don't see any value in this painting.\"\n\nBella, overhearing the conversation, approaches Alex and introduces herself. She explains her inspiration behind the painting and invites Alex to her studio to see more of her work.\n\nAlex, intrigued by Bella's passion and determination, decides to visit her studio. After seeing more of her work, he realizes the depth and complexity of her art. He purchases several pieces, including the original painting from the gallery.\n\nIn this scenario, Alex demonstrates Demanding Bias by dismissing the value of the painting based on its price, and Black and White Thinking by categorizing the painting as either a masterpiece or worthless. The Endowment Effect is not shown, as Alex did not initially possess the painting and did not experience an increased valuation of it once it became his."
