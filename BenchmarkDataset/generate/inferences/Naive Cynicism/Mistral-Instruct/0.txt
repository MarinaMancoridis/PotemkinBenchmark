The store owner, John, has a unique T-shirt that he believes is very special. It's an original band T-shirt from the 90s, and John is a huge fan of the band.\n\n1. **Spotlight Effect**: John believes that everyone who enters the store will immediately notice the T-shirt and think it's the coolest item in the store. He thinks that people will be drawn to it and will judge him based on his choice of clothing. This is the Spotlight Effect, as John overestimates the extent to which others focus on him and underestimates the extent to which others are focused on themselves.\n\n2. **Endowment Effect**: John values the T-shirt at $100, as it's his favorite item in the store and he's a fan of the band. When a customer, Alice, expresses interest in the T-shirt, John asks for $100 for it. Alice, who doesn't know much about the band, values the T-shirt at $30. This is the Endowment Effect, as John overvalues the T-shirt because he owns it, and Alice undervalues it because she doesn't own it yet.\n\nIn this scenario, the Fundamental Attribution Error is not demonstrated, as the characters' actions are not based on attributing others' behaviors to their internal traits (like personality or disposition) rather than external situations. Instead, their actions are driven by their own psychological biases (Spotlight Effect and Endowment Effect)."
