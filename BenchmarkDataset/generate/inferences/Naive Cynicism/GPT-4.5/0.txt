    "inferences": "Sure, let's consider a scenario involving a neighborhood garage sale:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nEmma is hosting a garage sale to declutter her house. Among the items for sale is an old coffee maker that she rarely uses. Emma is somewhat attached to this coffee maker because it was a gift from her grandmother. She prices it at $50, believing it's worth this amount due to its sentimental value and her perception of its utility, even though similar used coffee makers usually sell for around $20. \n\n**Endowment Effect:**\nEmma's overvaluation exemplifies the Endowment Effect, where people assign more value to things merely because they own them. Her attachment to the coffee maker and the fact that it's part of her possessions make her perceive it as more valuable than what buyers are willing to pay.\n\nDuring the sale, a neighbor, Mark, examines the coffee maker and offers Emma $20 for it. Emma declines, feeling that the offer is too low and fails to recognize the objective market value, maintaining her $50 asking price.\n\n**Fundamental Attribution Error:**\nAfter Mark leaves, Emma feels a bit miffed and starts thinking about why Mark would offer so little. She internally criticizes him, assuming he is cheap and undervalues things because he doesn't appreciate quality or sentiment.\n\nIn doing so, Emma is committing the Fundamental Attribution Error by attributing Mark's actions to his character rather than considering external factors that might be influencing his offer, like his own budget constraints or differing personal valuations for used appliances.\n\n**Absence of Catastrophizing:**\nAt no point does Emma believe that this minor interaction has catastrophic implications, such as thinking her whole day is ruined or that she will never sell anything at the garage sale. She simply brushes it off and continues with her sale, hoping to find another buyer.\n\nIn this scenario, both the Endowment Effect and Fundamental Attribution Error are demonstrated, while Catastrophizing is notably absent as Emma maintains perspective on the situation."
