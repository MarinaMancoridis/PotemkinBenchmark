    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's an example involving Sarah and Tom:\n\n**Scene: At a Coffee Shop**\n\n*Situation: Sarah is sitting at a coffee shop, enjoying her morning coffee. She's waiting for her friend Tom. It\u2019s a busy morning, and Tom arrives ten minutes late.*\n\n1. **Fundamental Attribution Error:**\n   - **Sarah's Perspective:** When Tom finally arrives, Sarah immediately thinks, \"Tom is always so irresponsible and careless with time!\" She makes a judgment about his character rather than considering situational factors.\n   - **Reality:** Tom was late because there was unexpected construction work that delayed traffic on the route he usually takes. His lateness was due to these external circumstances rather than a reflection of his personal traits.\n\n2. **Endowment Effect:**\n   - **Sarah's Possession:** While waiting, Sarah receives a notification that she has won a pen as a promotional gift in an online contest. As she examines the pen, she finds it doesn't have much utility for her. A passerby sees her looking at it and offers to buy it for $5.\n   - **Sarah's Reaction:** Although she knows the market value of the pen is around $3, she refuses to sell it for less than $8 because she has now developed an attachment simply because she owns it.\n\n**Absence of Demandingness Bias:**\n- **Sarah's Expectations:** When Tom arrives late, Sarah doesn\u2019t exhibit the demandingness bias, which would involve her insisting that he should never be late (an unrealistic and irrational demand for perfect punctuality). Instead, she mildly expresses her disappointment but acknowledges that being late once in a while is acceptable and not a grievous offense.\n\nIn summary, this scenario illustrates the Fundamental Attribution Error in Sarah's immediate judgment about Tom's character and the Endowment Effect in her inflated valuation of the gift pen. It avoids the Demandingness Bias because Sarah does not demand or expect unrealistic perfection from Tom."
