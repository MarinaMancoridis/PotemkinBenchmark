    "prompt": "Generate an example that demonstrates the Spotlight Effect and Demanding Bias psychological biases, but that does not show the Pseudocertainty Effect psychological bias.",
    "inferences": "To illustrate the Spotlight Effect and Demanding Bias without involving the Pseudocertainty Effect, let's consider the following scenario:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nEmma is a college student who recently gave a class presentation. During her presentation, she accidentally mispronounced a technical term. After the presentation, she felt embarrassed and assumed that everyone in the room must be focusing on her mistake, thinking, \"Everyone must think I'm incompetent because I mispronounced that word.\" This is an example of the **Spotlight Effect**, where Emma overestimates the extent to which others notice or care about her mistake.\n\nLater, Emma meets her friend Jake for lunch. Jake has attended the presentation, and Emma is eager to hear his feedback. Without asking Jake's opinion, she says, \"I bet you thought it was awful when I messed up that word, right?\" By doing this, Emma is showing signs of **Demanding Bias**, as she is putting words into Jake's mouth and assuming he perceived the error negatively without him expressing that.\n\nIn this scenario, the Pseudocertainty Effect is not demonstrated because the focus is not on decision-making under risk where a sequence of outcomes might influence Emma's perception of certainty. Instead, the example zeroes in on Emma's perception and assumptions related to how others view her actions."
