They both attend an auction where a rare painting by a renowned artist is up for sale. The painting is estimated to be worth $5,000, but the bidding starts at $1,000.\n\n1. The Fundamental Attribution Error:\n\nAlice, who has a strong belief in the artist's talent, decides to bid on the painting. She believes that the artist's skill and creativity are the primary reasons for the painting's high value. When she wins the auction for $2,500, she assumes that the other bidders were not as knowledgeable or passionate about art as she is. This is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, as Alice attributes the other bidders' actions to their internal traits (lack of knowledge or passion) rather than considering the role of external factors (the auction dynamics, the rarity of the painting, etc.).\n\n2. The Endowment Effect:\n\nAfter winning the auction, Alice finds out that Bob also wanted the painting but did not bid because he thought it was too expensive. A few days later, Alice decides to sell the painting to cover some expenses. She lists it for sale at $4,000, a price she feels is fair given her initial investment of $2,500. Bob, however, values the painting at $5,000 because he now \"owns\" it in his mind, even though he never actually purchased it. This demonstrates the Endowment Effect, as both Alice and Bob overvalue the painting due to their psychological attachment to it.\n\nIn this example, the Normalcy Bias is not shown because there is no situation where Alice or Bob expects things to be \"normal\" and fails to prepare or react appropriately to an abnormal situation. Instead, the focus is on the psychological biases that influence their perceptions and decisions regarding the art auction."
