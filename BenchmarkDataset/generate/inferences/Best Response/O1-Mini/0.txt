Additionally, all numbers within the payoff matrix must be unique.\n\nGiven the condition for Player 2's best response to Player 1's third action, we will set it up such that Player 2 has a higher payoff in the second column of the bottom row.\n\nAfter developing a strategy, let us then output the matrix which satisfies the stated constraints:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,2), (3,8), (7,4) ],\n [ (5,0), (11,6), (9,10) ],\n [ (12,13), (15,14), (17,16) ]]\n",
