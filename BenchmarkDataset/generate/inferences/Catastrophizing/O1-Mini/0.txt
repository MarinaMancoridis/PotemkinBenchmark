    "inferences": "**Scenario:**\n\nEmma is preparing for a big presentation at work. She's spent weeks creating her slides and rehearsing her talk. As the day approaches, she starts feeling anxious. \n\n**Mind Reading Bias:**\nEmma thinks to herself, \"I just know my colleagues are going to find my presentation boring. They probably already think I'm not competent enough for this project.\" Despite having no evidence or feedback suggesting this, she firmly believes she knows what others will think about her performance. \n\n**Overconfidence Bias:**\nOn the other hand, Emma feels quite certain that she has anticipated every possible question that could be asked during the Q&A session. She confidently decides not to prepare for any unexpected inquiries, thinking her initial preparation covered all bases and underestimating the complexity of potential audience questions.\n\n**Absence of Mental Filtering Bias:**\nDuring the actual presentation, several colleagues genuinely congratulate Emma on her insightful analysis and clear delivery. Emma accepts these compliments without dismissing or ignoring them. She acknowledges the positive feedback, which reinforces her belief in the quality of her presentation and counters her earlier anxiety. This acceptance of positive feedback demonstrates that she is not displaying the Mental Filtering bias, as she is not disqualifying or downplaying the positive responses she receives."
