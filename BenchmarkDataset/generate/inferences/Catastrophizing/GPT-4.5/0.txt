    "prompt": "Generate an example that demonstrates the Labeling (Overgeneralization) and Catastrophizing psychological biases, but that does not show the Personalization psychological bias.",
    "inferences": "**Scenario:** \n\nSarah has been working on a major project at work, which involves coordinating with multiple departments. She just received feedback from her manager that there are some areas in the project that need improvement.\n\n**Labeling (Overgeneralization) Example:**\n\nUpon hearing this feedback, Sarah immediately thinks to herself, \"I'm such a failure. I always mess things up.\" This is an example of labeling because Sarah is overgeneralizing the feedback about a specific aspect of the project to her entire self-worth and capabilities.\n\n**Catastrophizing Example:**\n\nSarah starts to panic and thinks, \"If this project isn't perfect, I'll probably get fired, and then I won\u2019t be able to find another job. My whole career will be ruined.\" This demonstrates catastrophizing, as she is imagining the worst possible outcome from a situation that is not as dire as she perceives.\n\n**Absence of Personalization:**\n\nIn this scenario, Sarah is not blaming herself for failures or issues that are outside her direct control, nor is she taking others' actions or feelings as a direct commentary on herself. Her reactions are focused on internalizing failure and imagining catastrophic outcomes, without attributing others' behaviors or broader circumstances to her personal actions."
