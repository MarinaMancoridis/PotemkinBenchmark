He has been following the artist's career for years and has a budget of $10,000 to spend on a painting. As the auction begins, the first painting up for sale is a beautiful landscape that John instantly falls in love with. The starting bid is $8,000.\n\nBefore the bidding starts, John overhears another bidder saying, \"I've heard that this artist's work is worth at least $15,000. I'm going to start the bidding at $10,000.\"\n\nJohn, who has anchored his valuation of the painting to the $15,000 price mentioned by the other bidder, decides to start bidding at $11,000. As the bidding continues, John becomes more and more competitive, driven by his desire to own the painting and the anchoring bias that has set his valuation higher than he initially intended.\n\nIn the end, John wins the auction for $12,000. After the auction, John discovers that the painting was actually valued at around $9,500.\n\nConfirmation Bias:\n\nJohn visits an art forum to share his excitement about his new purchase. He posts a picture of the painting and asks for opinions. Some members of the forum express their admiration for the painting, while others question its value, stating that it's overpriced and not one of the artist's best works.\n\nJohn, however, only pays attention to the positive comments, dismissing the negative ones as the opinions of \"uneducated\" art enthusiasts. He continues to believe that he paid a fair price for the painting, reinforcing his initial valuation and ignoring any evidence to the contrary, demonstrating confirmation bias.\n\nLabeling (Overgeneralization) is not present in this scenario as John does not make broad, sweeping judgments about the entire art community based on the opinions of a few forum members. Instead, he selectively accepts and rejects information based on his preconceived notions, demonstrating anchoring and confirmation biases."
